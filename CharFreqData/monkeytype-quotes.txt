you
have
the
power
to
heal
your
life,
and
you
need
to
know
that.
they
don;t
know
that
we
know
they
know
we
know.
don;t
it
make
you
sad
to
know
that
life
is
more
than
who
you
are?
leave
something
for
someone
but
don;t
leave
someone
for
something.
the
people
with
ideas
have
no
power
and
the
people
with
power
have
no
ideas.
you
must
take
life
the
way
it
comes
at
you
and
make
the
best
of
it.
if
you
don;t
know
what
you
want,
how
are
you
going
to
know
when
you
get
it?
if
you
have
to
ask
you
will
never
know,
if
you
know
you
need
only
ask.
your
memory
is
the
glue
that
binds
your
life
together.
i;m
sure
there
are
things
you
know
that
you
don;t
even
know
you
know.
perhaps
if
you
know
you
are
insane
then
you
are
not
insane.
you
can;t
use
the
fire
exit
because
you;re
not
made
of
fire.
the
person
that
has
the
most
to
do
with
what
happens
to
you
is
you!
there
are
darknesses
in
life
and
there
are
lights,
and
you
are
one
of
the
lights,
the
light
of
all
lights.
sometimes
the
world
as
you
know
it
just
decides
to
become
something
else.
if
you
only
do
what
you
can
do,
you
will
never
be
more
than
who
you
are
now.
if
i
have
to
hear
one
more
time
that
you
did
this
for
the
family...
and
in
the
end,
the
love
you
take
is
equal
to
the
love
you
make.
i;ve
always
loved
you,
and
when
you
love
someone,
you
love
the
whole
person,
just
as
he
or
she
is,
and
not
as
you
would
like
them
to
be.
memory
is
a
way
of
holding
onto
the
things
you
love,
the
things
you
are,
the
things
you
never
want
to
lose.
you
should
never,
never
doubt
something
that
no
one
is
sure
of.
make
sure
you
marry
someone
who
laughs
at
the
same
things
you
do.
if
you
think
that
you
are
going
to
love
something,
give
it
a
try.
i
have
waited
lifetimes
to
find
you.
now
that
you;re
here
i
can
remind
you
of
the
things
i;ve
been
dreaming
of
times
two.
are
you
trying
to
impress
me?
what
would
impress
me
more
is
if
you
never
did
that
again.
yeah
it;s
you,
you;re
the
one
that
makes
me
feel
right.
i;ve
been
in
love
with
her
for
ages
and
i
can;t
seem
to
get
it
right.
i
fell
in
love
with
her
in
stages
my
whole
life.
believe
in
one
thing
too
much
and
you
have
no
room
for
new
ideas.
cleaning
your
house
while
kids
are
around
is
like
shoveling
the
walk
while
it;s
still
snowing.
the
day
the
power
of
love
overrules
the
love
of
power,
the
world
will
know
peace.
i
am
the
wisest
man
alive,
for
i
know
one
thing,
and
that
is
that
i
know
nothing.
for
all
the
things
you;ve
done,
for
the
things
you
might
have
done,
and
for
the
only
thing
you
have
left.
you
can;t
convince
me
what
i
want
and
what
i
need
are
separate
things.
it;s
easy
not
to
abuse
your
power
when
you
don;t
actually
have
any
power.
i
often
think
that
men
don;t
understand
what
is
noble
and
what
is
ignorant,
though
they
always
talk
about
it.
now
is
the
time
for
resting.
some
things
are
ill
to
hear
when
the
world;s
in
shadow.
courage
is
resistance
to
fear,
mastery
of
fear
-
not
absence
of
fear.
there;s
no
reason
a
fake
can;t
do
what
the
real
thing
would.
and
it;s
possible
for
a
fake
to
be
more
real
than
the
real
thing.
it
matters
not
how
a
man
dies,
but
how
he
lives.
the
act
of
dying
is
not
of
importance,
it
lasts
so
short
a
time.
there
is
something
about
yourself
that
you
don;t
know.
i
am
he
as
you
are
he
as
you
are
me
and
we
are
all
together.
anything
is
edible
if
you
deep
fry
it
long
enough.
there
will
come
a
time
when
all
of
us
are
dead.
we
know
little
of
who
we
were,
only
something
of
who
we
are,
and
nothing
of
who
we
may
be.
you
know
when
i
was
a
kid
i
always
wanted
to
be
a
cowboy,
and
now
knowing
i;m
going
to
spend
my
future
in
the
past
sounds
like
a
wonderful
way
to
spend
my
retirement
years.
when
we
remember
we
only
get
a
version
of
the
last
time
we
remember
it.
when
you
realize
you
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
with
somebody,
you
want
the
rest
of
your
life
to
start
as
soon
as
possible.
where
do
you
think
you;re
going?
because
i
don;t
think
you;re
going
where
you
think
you;re
going.
when
everyone
else
was
thinking
it
was
time
for
bed,
his
mind
was
telling
him
it;s
time
to
get
ahead
of
the
competition.
you
must
learn
from
the
mistakes
of
others
because
you
can;t
possibly
live
long
enough
to
make
them
all
yourself.
i
would
rather
spend
one
lifetime
with
you,
than
face
all
the
ages
of
this
world
alone.
you
can
get
more
of
what
you
want
with
a
kind
word
and
a
gun
than
you
can
with
just
a
kind
word.
thinking
you
know
everything
there
is
to
know
about
something
will
only
hold
you
back,
because
it
prevents
you
from
learning
anything
new.
sometimes
it
takes
heart
to
write
about
a
thing,
doesn;t
it?
to
let
that
thing
out
of
the
room
way
in
the
back
of
your
mind
and
put
it
up
there
on
the
screen.
i;m
going
to
take
my
time.
i
have
all
the
time
in
the
world.
you
are
what
you
are
and
you
are
where
you
are
because
of
what
has
gone
into
your
mind.
you
change
what
you
are
and
you
change
where
you
are
by
changing
what
goes
into
your
mind.
there
are
many
things
that
i
would
like
to
say
to
you
but
i
don;t
know
how.
i
love
to
type
crazy
stuff.
when
you
lose
the
ones
you
love,
you
might
find
it
hard
to
cry.
until
it;s
only
you
and
everybody
else
has
left
the
room,
you
might
feel
what
it;s
like
to
not
know
how
to
feel.
she
had
waited
all
her
life
for
something
and
it
had
killed
her
when
it
found
her.
this
truth
holds
me
close,
rocking
me
like
a
child
in
a
mother;s
arms.
if
you
didn;t
have
me
to
rake
you
over
the
coals
now
and
then,
there
wouldn;t
be
any
fire
in
your
life
at
all.
those
who
have
made
something
of
their
lives
will
always
look
at
those
who
haven;t
as
clowns.
this
is
not
the
end,
this
is
not
even
the
beginning
of
the
end,
this
is
just
perhaps
the
end
of
the
beginning.
you
are
the
most
important
thing
to
me
now.
the
most
important
thing
to
me
ever.
believe
me,
the
irony
of
being
a
blind
art
dealer
isn;t
lost
on
me.
if
you
don;t
like
how
things
are,
change
it!
you;re
not
a
tree.
i
just
want
to
be
able
to
stand
up
straight
for
a
little
while
before
i
get
cut
down.
take
me
up,
take
me
higher,
there;s
a
world
not
far
from
here.
we
can
dance
in
desire
or
we
can
burn
in
love
tonight.
our
hearts
are
like
firestones
and
when
they
strike
we
feel
the
love.
you
don;t
need
a
weather
man
to
know
which
way
the
wind
blows.
the
world
was
reduced
to
the
surface
of
her
skin
and
her
inner
self
was
safe
from
all
bitterness.
you
have
to
keep
your
mind
as
wide-open
as
your
eyes,
because
almost
nothing
is
what
it
seems.
the
world
is
a
dangerous
place
to
live,
not
because
of
the
people
who
are
evil,
but
because
of
the
people
who
don;t
do
anything
about
it.
sometimes
life
is
like
this
tunnel.
you
can;t
always
see
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel,
but
if
you
keep
moving,
you
will
come
to
a
better
place.
this
is
the
second
most
tragic
thing
to
happen
in
my
life...
lights
up
and
they
know
who
you
are,
know
who
you
are.
do
you
know
who
you
are?
i
learnt
long
ago
to
hate
my
enemies,
but
i;ve
never
loved
one
before.
from
there
to
here,
from
here
to
there,
funny
things
are
everywhere.
he
misses
the
time
he
had
with
you.
i
miss
the
time
i
didn;t
have.
today;s
the
first
day
of
the
end
of
your
lives.
never
imagine
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
otherwise.
i
know
it;s
a
mistake.
but
there
are
certain
things
in
life
where
you
know
it;s
a
mistake,
but
you
don;t
really
know
it;s
a
mistake,
because
the
only
way
to
really
know
it;s
a
mistake
is
to
make
the
mistake.
to
be
able
to
say
how
much
you
love
is
to
love
but
little.
this
day
does
not
belong
to
one
man
but
to
all.
let
us
together
rebuild
this
world
that
we
may
share
in
the
days
of
peace.
the
mark
of
the
immature
man
is
that
he
wants
to
die
nobly
for
a
cause,
while
the
mark
of
the
mature
man
is
that
he
wants
to
live
humbly
for
one.
no
one
really
knows
why
they;re
alive
until
they
know
what
they;d
die
for.
i
came
to
realize
that
i
had
more
to
offer
this
world
than
just
making
things
that
blow
up.
for
what
you
see
and
hear
depends
a
good
deal
on
where
you
are
standing.
it
also
depends
on
what
sort
of
person
you
are.
and
he
told
us
of
his
life
in
the
land
of
submarines.
that
was
what
i
wanted,
but
i
don;t
need
it
to
be
gone.
i
can
love
you
and
i
can
love
life
and
bear
the
pain
all
at
the
same
time.
i
think
the
pain
might
even
make
the
rest
better,
the
way
a
good
setting
can
make
a
diamond
look
better.
they;re
surrounding
the
city
to
make
a
fortress
so
that
no
one
can
see
what
they;re
up
to
inside.
our
only
chance
is
the
element
of
surprise.
however
small
the
chance
might
be
of
striking
lucky,
the
chance
was
there.
but
i
really
believe
that
there
are
more
good
people
on
this
earth
than
bad
people,
and
the
good
people
watch
out
for
each
other
and
take
care
of
each
other.
there
is
freedom
in
coming
and
going
for
no
other
reason
than
because
you
can.
there
is
freedom
in
choosing
to
sit
and
be
still
when
everything
is
always
telling
you
to
move,
move
fast.
no
matter
where
you
stand
on
the
long
path,
right
now,
try
very
hard
to
smile,
and
be
glad
you;re
in
the
game.
you
don;t
get
to
choose
if
you
get
hurt
in
this
world,
but
you
do
have
some
say
in
who
hurts
you.
i;d
tell
you
all
you
want
and
more,
if
the
sounds
i
made
could
be
what
you
hear.
i
think
reality
is
thin,
you
know,
thin
as
lake
ice
after
a
thaw,
and
we
fill
our
lives
with
noise
and
light
and
motion
to
hide
that
thinness
from
ourselves.
therefore
a
man
shall
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
be
joined
to
his
wife,
and
they
shall
become
one
flesh.
if
you
think
anyone
is
sane
you
just
don;t
know
enough
about
them.
the
thing
about
a
story
is
that
you
dream
it
as
you
tell
it,
hoping
that
others
might
then
dream
along
with
you,
and
in
this
way
memory
and
imagination
and
language
combine
to
make
spirits
in
the
head.
there
is
the
illusion
of
aliveness.
treachery
and
violence
are
spears
pointed
at
both
ends;
they
wound
those
who
resort
to
them
worse
than
their
enemies.
you
see,
the
rays
from
the
star
pass
so
near
the
sun
that
they
get
bent
on
the
way
to
us.
stop
the
world
and
let
me
off,
i;m
tired
of
going
round
and
round.
i
played
the
game
of
love
and
lost.
so
stop
the
world
and
let
me
off.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
the
love
is
ours
to
make
so
we
should
make
it.
i
know
just
how
to
whisper
and
i
know
just
how
to
cry.
i
know
just
where
to
find
the
answers
and
i
know
just
how
to
lie.
i
know
just
how
to
fake
it
and
i
know
just
how
to
scheme.
i
know
just
when
to
face
the
truth
and
then
i
know
just
when
to
dream.
nothing
is
more
wonderful
than
the
art
of
being
free,
but
nothing
is
harder
to
learn
how
to
use
than
freedom.
there
was
never
any
more
inception
than
there
is
now,
nor
any
more
youth
or
age
than
there
is
now;
and
will
never
be
any
more
perfection
than
there
is
now,
nor
any
more
heaven
or
hell
than
there
is
now.
never
become
used
to
anything
you
love.
it
blunts
the
edge
of
appreciation.
maybe,
the
only
thing
that
has
to
make
sense
about
being
somebody;s
friend
is
that
you
help
them
be
their
best
self
on
any
given
day.
that
you
give
them
a
home
when
they
don;t
want
to
be
in
their
own.
there
is
nothing
a
man
cannot
do
once
he
accepts
the
fact
that
there
is
no
god.
for
as
it
is
not
one
swallow
or
one
fine
day
that
makes
a
spring,
so
it
is
not
one
day
or
a
short
time
that
makes
a
man
blessed
and
happy.
do
not
act
as
if
you
were
going
to
live
ten
thousand
years.
death
hangs
over
you.
while
you
live,
while
it
is
in
your
power,
be
good.
we
all
require
devotion
to
something
more
than
ourselves
for
our
lives
to
be
endurable.
for
all
those
times
you
stood
by
me,
for
all
the
truth
that
you
made
me
see,
for
all
the
joy
you
brought
to
my
life,
for
all
the
wrong
that
you
made
right.
was
it
all
put
into
words,
or
did
both
understand
that
they
had
the
same
thing
at
heart
and
in
their
minds,
so
that
there
was
no
need
to
speak
of
it
aloud,
and
better
not
to
speak
of
it?
i
never
wanted
that.
of
course,
it;s
one
thing
not
to
want
something;
it;s
another
to
be
told
you
can;t
have
it.
i
guess
it;s
just
nice
knowing
that
you
could
someday
do
it
if
you
change
your
mind.
but
now,
all
of
a
sudden,
that
door
is
closed.
learning
does
not
make
one
learned:
there
are
those
who
have
knowledge
and
those
who
have
understanding.
the
first
requires
memory
and
the
second
philosophy.
you
don;t
make
history
by
following
the
rules,
you
make
it
by
seizing
the
moment.
i
don;t
want
to
live
someone
else;s
idea
of
how
to
live.
you
don;t
know
what;s
in
store,
but
you
know
what
you;re
here
for.
the
great
breakthrough
in
your
life
comes
when
you
realize
that
you
can
learn
anything
you
need
to
learn
to
accomplish
any
goal
that
you
set
for
yourself.
it
seems
to
me
you
lived
your
life
like
a
candle
in
the
wind,
never
knowing
who
to
cling
to
when
the
rain
set
in.
and
i
would
have
liked
to
have
known
you
but
i
was
just
a
kid.
a
book
can
give
you
an
experience
of
someone;s
life
in
a
few
hours,
and
this
is
far
more
profitable
than
any
sale
that;s
going
on.
you
can
always
build
a
shrine
to
all
the
terrible
things
in
the
world,
but
it
doesn;t
mean
that
you
have
to
destroy
anything
that
is
good.
they
had
taken
it
all
away
from
him
now,
they
had
turned
away
from
him
and
there
was
nothing
for
him
now.
he
was
alone
and
there
was
nothing
for
him.
she
was
feeling
the
pressure
of
the
world
outside
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
and
feel
his
presence
beside
her
and
be
reassured
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
after
all.
something
in
the
wind
has
learned
my
name
and
it;s
telling
me
that
things
are
not
the
same.
in
the
leaves
on
the
trees
and
the
touch
of
the
breeze
there;s
a
pleasing
sense
of
happiness
for
me.
some
people
pass
through
your
life
and
you
never
think
about
them
again.
some
you
think
about
and
wonder
what
ever
happened
to
them.
some
you
wonder
if
they
ever
wonder
what
happened
to
you.
and
then
there
are
some
you
wish
you
never
had
to
think
about
again.
but
you
do.
i
don;t
want
my
thoughts
to
die
with
me,
i
want
to
have
done
something.
i;m
not
interested
in
power,
or
piles
of
money.
i
want
to
leave
something
behind.
i
want
to
make
a
positive
contribution
-
know
that
my
life
has
meaning.
they
don;t
know
our
world
but
they
know
their
own.
i
don;t
think
i
was
wrong
to
have
held
on
to
my
secrets
for
all
those
years,
and
i
don;t
think
i
was
wrong
to
have
told
them
now.
circumstances
changed,
and
once
they
changed,
i
changed
my
mind
as
well.
if
actions
speak
louder
than
words
i;m
the
most
deafening
noise
you;ve
heard.
i;ll
be
that
ringing
in
your
ears
that
will
stick
around
for
years.
i
love
the
ground
under
his
feet,
and
the
air
over
his
head,
and
everything
he
touches
and
every
word
he
says.
i
love
all
his
looks,
and
all
his
actions
and
him
entirely
and
all
together.
you
forget
what
you
want
to
remember
and
you
remember
what
you
want
to
forget.
never
say
anything
unless
it
is
worth
taking
a
long
time
to
say.
in
every
war,
there
are
calms
between
storms.
there
will
be
days
when
you
lose
faith
in
some
of
us,
days
when
our
allies
turn
against
us,
but
the
day
will
never
come
if
we
forsake
this
planet
and
its
people.
we
look
not
at
the
things
which
are
what
you
would
call
seen,
but
at
the
things
which
are
not
seen.
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal.
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
eternal.
and
i
will
say
that
we
should
take
a
day
to
break
away
from
all
the
pain
our
brain
has
made,
the
game
is
not
played
alone.
and
i
will
say
that
we
should
take
a
moment
and
hold
it
and
keep
it
frozen
and
know
that
life
has
a
hopeful
undertone.
it
was
one
of
those
march
days
when
the
sun
shines
hot
and
the
wind
blows
cold:
when
it
is
summer
in
the
light,
and
winter
in
the
shade.
even
good
people
are
great
at
making
bad
decisions.
monsters
come
in
all
shapes
and
sizes.
some
of
them
are
things
people
are
scared
of.
some
of
them
are
things
that
look
like
things
people
used
to
be
scared
of
a
long
time
ago.
sometimes
monsters
are
things
people
should
be
scared
of,
but
they
aren;t.
spend
all
your
time
waiting
for
that
second
chance,
for
a
break
that
would
make
it
okay.
there;s
always
some
reason
to
feel
not
good
enough
and
it;s
hard
at
the
end
of
the
day.
any
man
who
has
the
brains
to
think
and
the
nerve
to
act
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
country
is
considered
a
radical,
by
those
who
are
content
with
stagnation
and
willing
to
endure
disaster.
i
don;t
believe
that
anybody
feels
the
way
i
do
about
you
now.
if
you
lie
and
pretend
that
you
like
them,
you;re
fine.
but
if
you
tell
them
the
truth,
you
get
fired,
you
can;t
afford
food,
and
you
get
shanked
for
cutting
in
line
at
the
soup
kitchen.
and
then
you
die.
a
body
has
one
more
kind
of
pull.
this
pull
is
such
that
it
will
want
to
stay
put
all
the
time.
and
the
more
mass
it
has,
the
more
it
will
want
to
stay
put.
what
difference
does
it
make?
because
in
the
end,
when
you
lose
somebody,
every
candle,
every
prayer
is
not
going
to
make
up
for
the
fact
that
the
only
thing
you
have
left
is
a
hole
in
your
life
where
that
somebody
that
you
cared
about
used
to
be.
she
did
not
tell
them
to
clean
up
their
lives,
or
go
and
sin
no
more.
she
did
not
tell
them
they
were
the
blessed
of
the
earth,
its
inheriting
meek,
or
its
glory-bound
pure.
she
told
them
that
the
only
grace
they
could
have
is
the
grace
they
could
imagine.
that
if
they
could
not
see
it,
they
could
not
have
it.
i
don;t
want
to
talk
about
it!
every
time
i
think
about
something
nice,
you
remind
me
of
bad
things.
i
only
want
to
talk
about
the
nice
things.
someone
sits
on
the
shore
and
tells
him
how
the
waves
have
been
there
long
before
bill
existed,
and
that
they;d
still
be
there
long
after
he;s
gone.
bill
looks
out
at
the
water
and
thinks
of
all
the
wonderful
things
he
will
do
with
his
life.
when
it;s
coming
at
you
like
monsters
in
the
night,
and
you
feel
the
danger
that
makes
you
want
to
hide;
when
the
cards
are
stacked
against
you
and
you;re
standing
on
the
edge:
now;s
the
time.
certain
things,
they
should
stay
the
way
they
are.
you
ought
to
be
able
to
stick
them
in
one
of
those
big
glass
cases
and
just
leave
them
alone.
but
of
bliss
and
glad
life
there
is
little
to
be
said,
before
it
ends;
as
works
fair
and
wonderful,
while
they
still
endure
for
eyes
to
see,
are
ever
their
own
record,
and
only
when
they
are
in
peril
and
broken
for
ever
do
they
pass
into
song.
if
you
come
to
a
river
and
find
a
boat
at
the
edge,
you
will
use
that
boat
and
it
will
serve
you
well,
but
once
across
the
river,
do
you
put
the
boat
on
your
shoulders
and
carry
it
with
you
on
the
rest
of
your
journey?
well,
we
used
to
look
up
in
the
sky
and
wonder
at
our
place
in
the
stars.
now
we
just
look
down
and
worry
about
our
place
in
the
dirt.
how
can
you
tell
me
that
you;re
lonely
and
say
for
you
that
the
sun
don;t
shine?
let
me
take
you
by
the
hand
and
lead
you
through
the
streets
of
london.
i;ll
show
you
something
to
make
you
change
your
mind.
there;s
never
been
a
true
war
that
wasn;t
fought
between
two
sets
of
people
who
were
certain
they
were
in
the
right.
the
really
dangerous
people
believe
they
are
doing
whatever
they
are
doing
solely
and
only
because
it
is
without
question
the
right
thing
to
do.
and
that
is
what
makes
them
dangerous.
it;s
not
a
question
but
a
lesson
learned
in
time.
it;s
something
unpredictable,
but
in
the
end
it;s
right.
i
hope
you
had
the
time
of
your
life.
if
you
think
that
you
are
going
to
love
something,
give
it
a
try.
you;re
going
to
kick
yourself
in
the
butt
for
the
rest
of
your
life
if
you
don;t.
when
you
are
painting
you
should
take
a
flat
mirror
and
often
look
at
your
work
within
it,
and
it
will
then
be
seen
in
reverse,
and
will
appear
to
be
by
the
hand
of
some
other
master,
and
you
will
be
better
able
to
judge
of
its
faults
than
in
any
other
way.
we
now
know
that
most
of
the
stars
in
the
sky
have
worlds
around
them,
but
we
don;t
know
if
there;s
life
on
those
worlds.
we
know
there;s
life
on
our
own
world,
but
that
doesn;t
tell
us
whether
life
is
normal
or
not.
maybe
life
is
a
very
strange
thing
that
got
started
only
once,
and
none
of
the
other
worlds
have
anyone
on
them
to
wonder
about
this
question.
there
are
those
who
say
that
life
is
like
a
book,
with
chapters
for
each
event
in
your
life
and
a
limited
number
of
pages
on
which
you
can
spend
your
time.
but
i
prefer
to
think
that
a
book
is
like
a
life,
particularly
a
good
one,
which
is
well
to
worth
staying
up
all
night
to
finish.
what
i
really
lived
for
were
those
evenings
when
you
were
alone,
and
i
pretended
you
were
playing
just
for
me.
and
though
you
didn;t
know
it,
you
were
giving
me
some
of
the
happiest
hours
of
my
life.
i
pray
every
night
that
i
may
live
after
him;
because
i
would
rather
be
miserable
than
that
he
should
be
-
that
proves
i
love
him
better
than
myself.
some
say
better
things
will
come
our
way.
no
matter
what
they
try
to
say,
you
were
always
there
for
me.
some
way,
when
the
sun
begins
to
shine,
i
hear
a
song
from
another
time
and
fade
away.
it
feels
scary
to
talk,
because
once
the
words
are
out,
you
can;t
put
them
back
in.
but
if
you
write
words
and
they
don;t
come
out
the
way
you
want
them
to,
you
can
erase
them
and
start
over.
then
we
saw
him
pick
up
all
the
things
that
were
down.
he
picked
up
the
cake,
and
the
rake,
and
the
gown,
and
the
milk,
and
the
strings,
and
the
books,
and
the
dish,
and
the
fan,
and
the
cup,
and
the
ship,
and
the
fish.
it
may
sound
like
music
to
her.
i
can
do
better
with
my
teeth
in
a
cold
shower.
what
you
don;t
have
you
don;t
need
it
now.
what
you
don;t
know
you
can
feel
it
somehow.
what
you
don;t
have
you
don;t
need
it
now.
adios
rock
band
that
we
loved
the
most,
this
is
a
toast
to
what
you
did,
and
all
that
you
were
fighting
for.
who
could
do
more,
when
time
marches
on?
words
come
and
go,
we
will
sing
the
melodies
that
you
did
long
ago.
i;m
just
going
to
turn
through
a
few
things.
when
we
go
out
during
the
day
we
like
to
stick
to
groups
of
two,
just
for
safety.
the
red
door,
it;s
the
only
way
in
and
out
of
the
house.
that
stays
closed
and
locked
all
the
time.
i
have
the
keys,
this
is
the
only
set.
we
were
sent
here
for
something.
and
we
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god,
to
them
who
are
called
according
to
his
purpose.
sometimes
the
briefest
moments
capture
us,
force
us
to
take
them
in,
and
demand
that
we
live
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
reference
to
them.
the
oldest
and
strongest
emotion
of
mankind
is
fear,
and
the
oldest
and
strongest
kind
of
fear
is
fear
of
the
unknown.
people
aren;t
as
complex
as
you
think
they
are.
they;re
simple,
and
they
get
sad
or
angry
over
simple
things.
that;s
how
they
are.
they;re
quickly
affected
by
the
littlest
things
and
live
without
knowing
where
they;re
going
to
fall
down.
take
time
to
really
think
about
your
excuses
and
write
them
down.
these
are
the
same
excuses
that
you
always
use
to
stop
yourself
from
learning
something
new.
the
worst
part
of
having
someone
tell
you
about
their
vacation
is
trying
to
pretend
you;re
happy
for
them,
because
no
one
wants
to
hear
about
all
the
fun
they
didn;t
have.
the
law
clearly
states
that
magic
may
be
used
before
muggles
in
life
threatening
situations.
why
would
you
pay
for
a
cover
band
when
you
got
the
real
deal
right
here,
baby?
when
someone
is
crying,
of
course,
the
noble
thing
to
do
is
to
comfort
them.
but
if
someone
is
trying
to
hide
their
tears,
it
may
also
be
noble
to
pretend
you
do
not
notice
them.
the
green
eyes,
you;re
the
one
that
i
wanted
to
find
and
anyone
who
tried
to
deny
you,
must
be
out
of
their
mind.
this
is
the
song
i
will
sing
to
you
when
you;re
old
and
tired.
i
will
sing
it
to
remind
you
that
i;m
old
beside
you.
and
if
you;re
tired
of
hearing
my
voice
i;m
gonna
sing
it
to
you
anyway
;cause
i
know
that
if
we
made
it
this
far
those
differences
have
been
put
away.
i
thought:
that
is
the
fear.
i
have
lost
something
important,
and
i
cannot
find
it,
and
i
need
it.
it
is
fear
like
if
someone
lost
his
glasses
and
went
to
the
glasses
store
and
they
told
him
that
the
world
had
run
out
of
glasses
and
he
would
just
have
to
do
without.
one
of
the
great
conditions
of
anger
and
hatred
is,
that
you
must
tell
and
believe
lies
against
the
hated
object,
in
order,
as
we
said,
to
be
consistent.
let
us
learn
to
appreciate
there
will
be
times
when
the
trees
will
be
bare,
and
look
forward
to
the
time
when
we
may
pick
the
fruit.
but
her
brain
was
not
interested
in
the
future.
loaded
with
the
past
and
hungry
for
more,
it
left
her
no
room
to
imagine,
let
alone
plan
for,
the
next
day.
i
had
been
right,
i
was
still
right,
i
was
always
right.
i
had
lived
my
life
one
way
and
i
could
just
as
well
have
lived
it
another.
i
had
done
this
and
i
hadn;t
done
that.
i
hadn;t
done
this
thing
but
i
had
done
another.
she
sits
in
a
corner
by
the
door.
there
must
be
more
i
can
tell
her
if
she
really
wants
me
to
help
her.
i;ll
do
what
i
can
to
show
her
the
way,
and
maybe
one
day
i
will
free
her,
though
i
know
no
one
can
see
her.
i
don;t
know,
you;re
made
of
metal,
but
you
have
feelings...
and
that
means
you
have
a
soul,
and
souls
don;t
die...
mom
says
it;s
something
inside
of
all
good
things,
and
that
it
goes
on
forever
and
ever.
there
are
mysteries
to
the
universe
we
were
never
meant
to
solve,
but
who
we
are
and
why
we
are
here,
are
not
among
them,
those
answers
we
carry
inside.
there
is
only
one
wish
on
my
mind:
when
this
day
is
through
i
hope
that
i
will
find
that
tomorrow
will
be
just
the
same
for
you
and
me.
all
i
need
will
be
mine
if
you
are
here.
i
took
my
morning
walk,
i
took
my
evening
walk,
i
ate
something,
i
thought
about
something,
i
wrote,
i
napped
and
dreamt
something
too,
and
with
all
that
something,
i
still
have
nothing
because
so
much
of
something
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
you.
the
hills
are
alive
with
the
sound
of
music,
with
songs
they
have
sung
for
a
thousand
years.
the
hills
fill
my
heart
with
the
sound
of
music.
my
heart
wants
to
sing
every
song
it
hears.
i
used
to
dread
getting
older
because
i
thought
i
would
not
be
able
to
do
all
the
things
i
wanted
to
do,
but
now
that
i;m
older
i
find
that
i
don;t
want
to
do
them.
for
centuries,
the
battle
of
morality
was
fought
between
those
who
claimed
that
your
life
belongs
to
god
and
those
who
claimed
that
it
belongs
to
your
neighbors.
and
no
one
came
to
say
that
your
life
belongs
to
you
and
that
the
good
is
to
live
it.
the
light
and
the
dark
the
big
and
the
small.
just
keep
in
mind
you
need
no
more
at
all.
you;ve
seen
what
you
were
and
know
what
you;ll
be.
you;ve
seen
it
all,
there
is
no
more
to
see.
there
comes
a
time
when
we
heed
a
certain
call,
when
the
world
must
come
together
as
one.
there
are
people
dying
and
it;s
time
to
lend
a
hand
to
life,
the
greatest
gift
of
all.
yeah,
they
got
you
where
they
want
you.
there;s
a
better
life
and
you
think
about
it,
don;t
you?
it;s
a
rich
man;s
game
no
matter
what
they
call
it
and
you
spend
your
life
putting
money
in
his
wallet.
i
don;t
care
who
you
are,
where
you;re
from,
what
you
did,
as
long
as
you
love
me.
every
little
thing
that
you
have
said
and
done
feels
like
it;s
deep
within
me.
doesn;t
really
matter
if
you;re
on
the
run,
it
seems
like
we;re
meant
to
be.
i
have
lived
my
life
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
escape
fate,
anger,
or
pain.
bring
me
the
answers
and
the
road
that
leads
to
the
truth.
reveal
to
me
once
and
for
all,
how
all
of
this
will
end.
when
i
need
to
find
something
out,
i
just
go
out
and
look
for
somebody
that
knows
more
than
me,
and
i
go
and
ask
them.
sometimes
i
ask
pretty
hard.
late
into
the
night
i
write
and
the
pages
of
my
notebook
swell
from
all
the
words
i;ve
pressed
onto
them.
it
almost
feels
like
the
more
i
bruise
the
page
the
quicker
something
inside
me
heals.
mind
is
not
in
any
one
place.
every
cell
in
this
body
has
its
own
intelligence.
the
brain
is
sitting
in
your
head,
but
mind
is
all
over
the
place.
i
hope
it
is
true
that
a
man
can
die
and
yet
not
only
live
in
others
but
give
them
life,
and
not
only
life
but
that
great
consciousness
of
life.
for
one
thing,
time
is
the
very
thing
that
we
are
least
willing
to
allow.
doubting
someone
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing,
because
it
is
something
that
you
do
to
get
to
know
the
person
better.
what
is
really
bad
is
not
being
concerned
at
all.
look
at
the
sky,
the
sun
won;t
ask
the
world
if
it
can
rise.
look
at
your
mind,
and
ask
yourself
what
keeps
you
trapped
inside.
look
at
the
lights,
they
follow
you
when
you
run
and
hide.
look
at
the
sky,
the
sun
won;t
ask,
the
sun
won;t
ask
the
world
if
it
can
rise.
and
remember
also
that
in
fighting
against
man
we
must
not
come
to
resemble
him.
even
when
you
have
conquered
him,
do
not
adopt
his
vices.
to
make
power,
people
try
to
put
pieces
of
this
metal
close
enough
together
that
they
make
heat
fast,
but
not
so
close
that
they
go
out
of
control
and
blow
up.
this
is
very
hard,
but
there
is
so
much
heat
and
power
stored
in
this
metal
that
some
people
have
wanted
to
try
anyway.
you
can;t
always
get
what
you
want,
but
if
you
try
sometimes
you
might
find
you
get
what
you
need.
i
can
take
you
for
a
ride
on
my
big
green
tractor,
we
can
go
slow
or
make
it
go
faster,
down
through
the
woods
and
out
to
the
pasture,
long
as
i;m
with
you
it
really
don;t
matter.
you
must
love
your
work,
and
not
be
always
looking
over
the
edge
of
it,
wanting
your
play
to
begin.
and
the
other
is,
you
must
not
be
ashamed
of
your
work,
and
think
it
would
be
more
honorable
to
you
to
be
doing
something
else.
it
doesn;t
matter
where
you
go
or
what
you
do,
i
want
to
spend
each
moment
of
the
day
with
you.
look
what
has
happened
with
just
one
kiss,
i
never
knew
that
i
could
be
in
love
like
this.
i
can;t
believe
the
things
i
see.
the
path
that
i
have
chosen
now
has
led
me
to
a
wall,
and
with
each
passing
day
i
feel
a
little
more
like
something
dear
was
lost.
for
the
times
when
we;re
apart,
well,
then
close
your
eyes
and
know
these
words
are
coming
from
my
heart
and
then
if
you
can
remember
in
good
times
and
bad
times
i;ll
be
on
your
side
forevermore.
well,
you
told
me
i
have
a
plethora.
and
i
just
would
like
to
know
if
you
know
what
a
plethora
is.
i
would
not
like
to
think
that
a
person
would
tell
someone
he
has
a
plethora,
and
then
find
out
that
that
person
has
no
idea
what
it
means
to
have
a
plethora.
i
remember
how
you
said
that
sometimes
it
gets
just
a
little
hard
being
home.
there;s
sand
stuck
in
my
bed
and
memories
in
my
head,
love,
i;ve
been
trying
to
let
this
whole
thing
go.
if
he
stayed
at
home
and
carried
on
with
his
normal
life
he
would
be
a
thousand
times
superior
to
these
people
and
could
get
any
of
them
out
of
his
way
just
with
a
kick.
i
swear,
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
my
mother
is
better
at
than
getting
someone
to
agree
to
something
that
in
any
other
universe,
they
would
never
ever
consider.
growing
up
to
be
a
mommy
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
a
little
girl
can
want
to
do
but
there
are
other
things
in
life
she
can
do
as
well.
for
instance,
she
can
work
her
head
off
and
show
all
those
arrogant
boys
that
she;s
just
as
capable
and
intelligent
and
creative
as
any
little
stud
around!
he
really
had
been
through
death,
but
he
had
returned
because
he
could
not
bear
the
solitude.
in
the
casino,
the
cardinal
rule
is
to
keep
them
playing
and
to
keep
them
coming
back.
the
longer
they
play,
the
more
they
lose,
and
in
the
end,
we
get
it
all.
running
a
casino
is
like
robbing
a
bank
with
no
cops
around.
it
is
not
the
mountain
we
conquer
but
ourselves.
things
didn;t
turn
out
the
way
they;re
supposed
to,
but
what
can
you
do?
you
must
take
life
the
way
it
comes
at
you
and
make
the
best
of
it.
i;ve
dreamt
in
my
life
dreams
that
have
stayed
with
me
ever
after,
and
changed
my
ideas:
they;ve
gone
through
and
through
me,
like
wine
through
water,
and
altered
the
color
of
my
mind.
i
was
once
like
you
are
now,
and
i
know
that
it;s
not
easy
to
be
calm
when
you;ve
found
something
going
on.
but
take
your
time,
think
a
lot.
i
think
of
everything
you;ve
got,
for
you
will
still
be
here
tomorrow
but
your
dreams
may
not.
then
suddenly
the
humour
of
the
situation
came
into
my
mind:
the
thought
of
the
years
i
had
spent
in
study
and
toil
to
get
into
the
future
age,
and
now
my
passion
of
anxiety
to
get
out
of
it.
and
the
game
was
over
and
the
player
woke
up
from
the
dream.
and
the
player
began
a
new
dream.
and
the
player
dreamed
again,
dreamed
better.
and
the
player
was
the
universe.
and
the
player
was
love.
you
are
the
player.
wake
up.
education
is
the
most
powerful
weapon
which
you
can
use
to
change
the
world.
think
of
what
you;re
saying,
you
can
get
it
wrong
and
still
you
think
that
it;s
alright.
think
of
what
i;m
saying,
we
can
work
it
out
and
get
it
straight
or
say
good
night.
may
you
find
the
power
in
understanding
the
journey
of
others
to
help
create
your
own.
if
you
can
hear
this,
you;re
alone.
the
only
thing
left
of
me
is
the
sound
of
my
voice.
i
don;t
know
if
any
of
us
made
it.
so
let
me
tell
you
who
we
were.
and
how
we
fought
back.
a
long,
long
time
ago.
i
can
still
remember
how
that
music
used
to
make
me
smile.
and
i
knew
if
i
had
my
chance,
that
i
could
make
those
people
dance,
and
maybe
they;d
be
happy
for
a
while.
i
do
this
thing
where
i
think
i;m
really
sick,
but
i
won;t
go
to
the
doctor
to
find
out
about
it,
because
they
make
you
stay
real
still
in
a
real
small
place,
as
they
chart
up
your
insides
and
put
them
on
display.
they;d
see
all
of
it.
all
of
me.
all
the
good
that
won;t
come
out
of
me.
i
think
if
you
don;t
really
like
a
girl,
you
shouldn;t
horse
around
with
her
at
all,
and
if
you
do
like
her,
then
you;re
supposed
to
like
her
face,
and
if
you
like
her
face,
you
ought
to
be
careful
about
doing
crumby
stuff
to
it,
like
squirting
water
all
over
it.
it;s
really
too
bad
that
so
much
crumby
stuff
is
a
lot
of
fun
sometimes.
and
now
it;s
time
for
silly
songs
with
larry,
the
part
of
the
show
where
larry
comes
out
and
sings
a
silly
song.
you
plonker,
you
think
i
don;t
know
a
toilet
when
i
see
one?
you
were
going
to
flush
me
down
the
loo.
in
a
business
like
this
the
people
with
the
power
are
the
ones
that
have
the
understanding
of
what;s
going
on,
not
necessarily
the
ones
on
top.
i
wouldn;t
hold
my
breath
if
i
was
you,
you
broke
my
heart
and
there;s
nothing
you
can
do.
and
now
you
know,
now
you
know,
true
friends
stab
you
in
the
front.
and
as
we
wind
on
down
the
road,
our
shadows
taller
than
our
soul,
there
walks
a
lady
we
all
know
who
shines
white
light
and
wants
to
show
how
everything
still
turns
to
gold.
and
if
you
listen
very
hard
the
tune
will
come
to
you
at
last.
as
happens
sometimes,
a
moment
settled
and
hovered
and
remained
for
much
more
than
a
moment.
and
sound
stopped
and
movement
stopped
for
much,
much
more
than
a
moment.
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
almost
made
the
biggest
mistake
of
my
professional
life
and
it
was
because
i
was
doing
something
that
just
wasn;t
me.
i
never
should
have
told
you,
i
never
should
have
let
you
see
inside,
don;t
want
it
troubling
in
your
mind.
won;t
you
let
it
be?
it
is
unwise
to
make
something
permanent
when
the
whole
world
is
shifting.
there
may
be
a
time
when
this
symbol
means
something
treacherous
and
terrible,
rather
than
something
noble
and
literate.
few
other
griefs
amid
the
ill
chances
of
this
world
have
more
bitterness
and
shame
for
a
man;s
heart
than
to
behold
the
love
of
a
lady
so
fair
and
brave
that
cannot
be
returned.
spring
is
the
time
of
year
when
it
is
summer
in
the
sun
and
winter
in
the
shade.
when
you
meet
the
right
person,
you
know
it.
you
can;t
stop
thinking
about
them.
they
are
your
best
friend,
and
your
soulmate.
you
can;t
wait
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
with
them.
no
one
and
nothing
else
can
compare.
you
can
have
success
or
excuses,
but
you
can;t
have
them
both.
the
blade
is
as
good
as
though
it
had
just
come
out
of
the
grindstone.
say
what
you
will.
but
a
person
just
cannot
know
what
he
doesn;t
know.
and
you
can;t
always
see
that
a
bad
thing
is
going
to
happen
before
it
happens.
if
you
could,
no
bad
would
ever
come.
when
you
find
that
one
person
who
connects
you
to
the
world,
you
become
someone
different.
someone
better.
when
that
person
is
taken
from
you,
what
do
you
become
then?
losing
you
would
end
my
life
you
see,
;cause
you
mean
that
much
to
me.
you
could
have
told
me
yourself
that
you
loved
someone
else.
when
is
the
last
time
you
cared
about
something
except
yourself,
hot
rod?
you
name
me
one
time
and
i
will
take
it
all
back.
i
didn;t
think
so.
these
are
good
folk
around
here,
who
care
about
one
another.
i
don;t
want
;em
depending
on
someone
they
can;t
count
on.
people
don;t
suffer
from
insanity,
they
love
every
minute
of
it.
and
i
think
how
hope
may
be
the
thing
that
pulls
you
forward,
may
be
the
thing
that
keeps
you
going,
but
that
it;s
dangerous,
too,
that
it;s
painful
and
risky,
that
it;s
making
a
dare
to
the
world
and
when
has
the
world
ever
let
us
win
a
dare?
with
the
money
they
earn
they;ll
be
able
to
buy
more
police
and
political
power.
then
they
come
after
us.
right
now
we
have
the
unions
and
we
have
the
gambling
and
those
are
the
best
things
to
have.
i
learned
to
write
because
i
am
one
of
those
people
who
somehow
cannot
manage
the
common
communications
of
smiles
and
gestures,
but
must
use
words
to
get
across
things
that
other
people
would
never
need
to
say.
the
weird
thing
about
houses
is
that
they
almost
always
look
like
nothing
is
happening
inside
of
them,
even
though
they
contain
most
of
our
lives.
i
wondered
if
that
was
sort
of
the
point
of
architecture.
i
find
myself
so
furious
at
all
these
people
that
i
am
in
contact
with
just
for
controlling
me
or
whatever
but
you
know
they
are
not
even
aware
they
are
doing
it.
i
have
often
wondered
how
it
is
that
every
man
loves
himself
more
than
all
the
rest
of
men,
but
yet
sets
less
value
on
his
own
opinion
of
himself
than
on
the
opinion
of
others.
you
get
tough
like
me
and
you
don;t
get
hurt.
you
look
out
for
yourself
and
nothin;
can
touch
you...
sometimes
i;ll
start
a
sentence
and
i
don;t
even
know
where
it;s
going.
i
just
hope
that
i
find
it
along
the
way.
humans
need
to
practice
what
they
are
learning
a
good
deal
before
they
master
it.
furthermore,
they
tend
to
lose
a
good
deal
of
their
learning
when
they
cease
to
practice
the
skills
associated
with
this
learning
in
their
daily
lives.
at
the
root
of
every
large
struggle
in
life
is
the
need
to
be
honest
about
something
that
we
do
not
feel
we
can
be
honest
about.
we
lie
to
ourselves
or
other
people
because
the
truth
might
require
action
on
our
part,
and
action
requires
courage.
we
say
we
don;t
know
what
is
wrong,
when
we
do
know
what
is
wrong;
we
just
wish
we
didn;t.
they
say
that
money
doesn;t
bring
you
happiness,
i
say
neither
does
being
broke,
so
let
me
suffer
with
a
new
car.
i
could
work
at
a
problem
for
years,
but
to
wait
inactive
for
twenty-four
hours
-
that
is
another
matter.
what;s
the
use
you
learning
to
do
right
when
it;s
troublesome
to
do
right
and
ain;t
no
trouble
to
do
wrong,
and
the
wages
is
just
the
same?
maybe
i
will
never
be
all
the
things
that
i
wanna
be.
now
is
not
the
time
to
cry,
now;s
the
time
to
find
out
why.
i
think
you;re
the
same
as
me,
we
see
things
they;ll
never
see.
you
have
a
class
of
young
strong
men
and
women,
and
they
want
to
give
their
lives
to
something.
advertising
has
these
people
chasing
cars
and
clothes
they
don;t
need.
generations
have
been
working
in
jobs
they
hate,
just
so
they
can
buy
what
they
don;t
really
need.
you
and
marshall
belong
together.
the
two
of
you
have
something
most
people
search
their
whole
lives
for
and
never
find.
i
know
you
love
him
and
if
you
knew
what
he
was
going
through
right
now
you
wouldn;t
be
here
for
one
more
second.
i
bought
you
a
ticket
home.
marshall
is
one
of
the
best
people
i
know
and
it
won;t
be
long
until
someone
else
realizes
that
and
you
will
lose
him
forever.
well,
no
need
to
brood
on
what
tomorrow
may
bring.
for
one
thing,
tomorrow
will
be
certain
to
bring
worse
than
today,
for
many
days
to
come.
and
there
is
nothing
more
that
i
can
do
to
help
it.
the
board
is
set,
and
the
pieces
are
moving.
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
world
is
like
a
calm
pond,
and
that
anytime
a
person
does
even
the
smallest
thing,
it
is
as
if
a
stone
has
dropped
into
the
pond,
spreading
circles
of
ripples
further
and
further
out,
until
the
entire
world
has
been
changed
by
one
tiny
action.
and
when
he
came
to,
he
was
flat
on
his
back
on
the
beach
in
the
freezing
sand,
and
it
was
raining
out
of
a
low
sky,
and
the
tide
was
way
out.
i
told
him
that
you
were
really
smart.
and
they;ll
figure
it
out
soon
enough.
in
the
beginning,
i
thought
you
might
want
to
be
treated
like
any
other
kid.
there;s
a
piece
of
maria
in
every
song
that
i
sing.
and
the
price
of
a
memory
is
the
memory
of
the
sorrow
it
brings.
and
there
is
always
one
last
light
to
turn
out
and
one
last
bell
to
ring.
and
the
last
one
out
of
the
circus
has
to
lock
up
everything.
i
don;t
know
what
it
is
that
makes
me
love
you
so.
i
only
know
i
never
want
to
let
you
go
;cause
you
started
something.
can;t
you
see
that
ever
since
we
met
you;ve
had
a
hold
on
me?
this
is
where
i
feel
safe
inside
and
can
let
go
at
the
same
time.
when
i;m
here,
i
am
open
so
i
can
reach
the
infinite
sky.
i
thought
i
couldn;t
want
you
more,
but
i
was
wrong,
and
when
we
locked
in
our
stare,
then
i
wanted
you
more
than
air.
all
age
brings
is
space
between
your
words
and
what
they
mean
and
sighs
of
sympathy.
these
years
are
rings
with
time
to
grieve
alone
and
in
your
bed
sick
of
what;s
in
your
head.
all
your
worries
gone.
you
never
know
what
a
day
will
bring,
which
is
both
the
good
news
and
the
bad
news
of
life.
sometimes
it;s
the
very
people
who
no
one
imagines
anything
of
who
do
the
things
that
no
one
can
imagine.
demons
run
when
a
good
man
goes
to
war.
night
will
fall
and
drown
the
sun
when
a
good
man
goes
to
war.
friendship
dies
and
true
love
lies.
night
will
fall
and
the
dark
will
rise
when
a
good
man
goes
to
war.
demons
run
but
count
the
cost;
the
battle;s
won
but
the
child
is
lost.
there
was
a
little
boy
once
upon
a
time
who
in
spite
of
his
young
age
and
small
size
knew
his
mind.
for
every
copper
penny
and
clover
he
would
find,
he;d
make
a
wish
for
better
days
and
the
end
of
hard
times.
we
know
that
there
is
not
one
person
who,
after
hearing
these
words,
would
deny
their
truth
and
say
that
he
wanted
something
else,
but
he
would
believe
that
he
had
heard
exactly
what
he
had
desired
for
a
long
time
-
namely,
to
be
melted
in
unison
with
his
beloved,
and
the
two
of
them
become
one.
the
reason
is
that
our
ancient
nature
was
thus
and
we
were
whole.
and
so
love
is
merely
the
name
for
the
desire
and
pursuit
of
the
whole.
i
want
to
leave
my
footprints
in
the
sands
of
time.
know
there
was
something
that
meant
something
that
i
left
behind.
the
hearts
i
have
touched
will
be
the
proof
that
i
leave
that
i
made
a
difference
and
this
world
will
see
i
was
here.
now
that
i;ve
tried
to
talk
to
you
and
make
you
understand.
all
you
have
to
do
is
close
your
eyes
and
just
reach
out
your
hands
and
touch
me.
hold
me
close
don;t
ever
let
me
go.
there
is
nothing
sweeter
in
this
sad
world
than
the
sound
of
someone
you
love
calling
your
name.
what
you
need
to
learn,
children,
is
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
in
every
area
of
life.
and
once
you
learn
the
difference,
you
must
always
choose
the
right.
when
has
anyone
ever
told
me
i
had
the
right
to
stop
it
all
without
my
knuckles,
or
my
anger,
with
just
some
simple
words.
you
know
no
one
and
no
one
knows
you,
and
at
the
same
time
you
don;t
feel
like
a
stranger.
but
here
you
know
everyone
and
everyone
knows
you,
and
yet
you
are
a
stranger.
and
it;s
whispered
that
soon,
if
we
all
call
the
tune,
then
the
piper
will
lead
us
to
reason
and
a
new
day
will
dawn
for
those
who
stand
long
and
the
forests
will
echo
with
laughter.
i
think
that
if
i
ever
have
kids,
and
they
are
upset,
i
won;t
tell
them
that
people
are
starving
in
china
or
anything
like
that
because
it
wouldn;t
change
the
fact
that
they
were
upset.
and
even
if
somebody
else
has
it
much
worse,
that
doesn;t
really
change
the
fact
that
you
have
what
you
have.
one
day
you;re
in
a
funk
about
things,
telling
a
friend
that
years
of
evidence
point
to
the
conclusion
that
you
will
be
single
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
that
night
you
meet
someone,
and
a
year
later
you;re
engaged
to
be
married.
that
this
very
scenario
happened
to
me
is
likely
of
little
comfort
to
those
still
wondering
about
their
future.
now
that
i
look
back,
i
don;t
know
why
i
was
so
stressed
about
it
all
this
time.
funny
how
sometimes
you
worry
a
lot
about
something
and
it
turns
out
to
be
nothing.
sometimes
you
never
feel
meaner
than
the
moment
you
stop
being
mean.
it;s
like
how
turning
on
a
light
makes
you
realize
how
dark
the
room
had
gotten.
and
the
way
you
usually
act,
the
things
you
would
have
normally
done,
are
like
these
ghosts
that
everyone
can
see
but
pretends
not
to.
i;ve
been
looking
so
long
at
these
pictures
of
you
that
i
almost
believe
that
they;re
real.
i;ve
been
living
so
long
with
my
pictures
of
you
that
i
almost
believe
that
the
pictures
are
all
i
can
feel.
now
i
see
fire
inside
the
mountain,
i
see
fire
burning
the
trees,
and
i
see
fire
hollowing
souls.
i
see
fire,
blood
in
the
breeze,
and
i
hope
that
you
remember
me.
it;s
sad
to
say
that
kids
unaccepted
by
their
peers
really
never
learn
how
to
get
along
with
people
in
the
big
grown
up
world.
there
were
people
who
lied
for
gain,
people
who
lied
from
pain,
people
who
lied
simply
because
the
concept
of
telling
the
truth
was
utterly
alien
to
them...
and
then
there
were
people
who
lied
because
they
were
waiting
for
it
to
be
time
to
tell
the
truth.
why
is
it
that
when
you
awake
to
the
world
of
realities
you
nearly
always
feel,
sometimes
very
vividly,
that
the
vanished
dream
has
carried
with
it
some
enigma
which
you
have
failed
to
solve?
i
just
watched
the
man
that
i
love
go
to
prison
so
that
none
of
you
have
to,
and
it
hasn;t
been
five
minutes
and
you;re
already
ripping
each
other
apart.
it
is
a
love
based
on
giving
and
receiving
as
well
as
having
and
sharing.
and
the
love
that
they
give
and
have
is
shared
and
received.
and
through
this
having
and
giving
and
sharing
and
receiving,
we
too
can
share
and
love
and
have...
and
receive.
every
thought
and
every
word
works
for
you
or
against
you,
and
every
thought
that
you
confirm
to
be
true
becomes
a
belief.
when
you
change
a
belief,
you
change
a
mental
construction
and,
therefore,
your
life.
the
poor
and
the
middle
class
work
for
money.
the
rich
have
money
work
for
them.
if
a
person
can;t
answer
directly
to
your
question,
it;s
either
the
answer
is
too
painful
for
you
to
know
or
too
hard
for
them
to
admit.
these
memories
lose
their
meaning
when
i
think
of
love
as
something
new,
though
i
know
i;ll
never
lose
affection
for
people
and
things
that
went
before.
i
know
i;ll
often
stop
and
think
about
them.
look,
there;s
only
one
thing
worse
than
being
a
loser.
it;s
being
one
of
those
guys
that
sits
in
a
bar,
telling
the
story
of
how
he
became
a
loser,
and
i
never
want
that
to
happen
to
me.
so
you
run
and
you
run
to
catch
up
with
the
sun
but
it;s
sinking,
racing
around
to
come
up
behind
you
again.
the
sun
is
the
same
in
a
relative
way
but
you;re
older,
shorter
of
breath
and
one
day
closer
to
death.
even
though
the
bell
has
rung,
some
of
my
classmates
are
still
milling
around
on
the
ground.
it;s
the
first
week
of
the
second
semester
of
senior
year,
and
already
they;re
acting
as
if
they;re
almost
done
and
out
of
here.
i
don;t
want
to
live
someone
else;s
idea
of
how
to
live.
don;t
ask
me
to
do
that.
i
don;t
want
to
find
out
one
day
that
i;m
at
the
end
of
someone
else;s
life.
all
i
really
want
is
something
beautiful
to
say.
but
when
you
lose
something
you
love,
faith
takes
over.
you
have
to
pay
attention
to
what
you
lost.
you
have
to
undo
the
expectation.
as
a
young
child
my
mother
told
me
i
could
be
anyone
i
want
to
be.

out
this
is
called
identity
theft.
what
is
this
place,
and
who
am
i?
i
don;t
remember
my
name.
all
i
remember
is
that
i
don;t
know
my
name
and
that
i
can;t
remember
if
i
do
know
my
name.
i
have
this
strange
feeling
that
i;ve
forgotten
all
of
this
before.
and
certainly,
the
mistakes
that
we
male
and
female
mortals
make
when
we
have
our
own
way
might
fairly
raise
some
wonder
that
we
are
so
fond
of
it.
she
can
lead
you
to
love,
she
can
take
you
or
leave
you,
she
can
ask
for
the
truth,
but
she;ll
never
believe.
and
she;ll
take
what
you
give
her
as
long
as
it;s
free.
just
because
something
bears
the
aspect
of
the
inevitable
one
should
not,
therefore,
go
along
willingly
with
it.
i;m
on
the
top
of
the
world
looking
down
on
creation
and
the
only
explanation
i
can
find
is
the
love
that
i;ve
found
ever
since
you;ve
been
around.
your
love;s
put
me
at
the
top
of
the
world.
we
fell
in
love,
we
had
our
fun,
you
always
had
enough
dreams
for
both
of
us.
i
wonder
what
would
come
of
us
if
we
could
trade
these
ends
for
beginnings.
gonna
see
the
river
man,
gonna
tell
him
all
i
can
about
the
ban
on
feeling
free.
if
he
tells
me
all
he
knows
about
the
way
his
river
flows,
i
don;t
suppose
it;s
meant
for
me.
for
still
there
are
so
many
things
that
i
have
never
seen:
in
every
wood,
in
every
spring
there
is
a
different
green.
i
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think
of
people
long
ago,
and
people
who
will
see
a
world
that
i
shall
never
know.
your
future
hasn;t
been
written
yet;
no
one;s
has.
your
future
is
whatever
you
make
it,
so
make
it
a
good
one.
failure
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of.
if
you
learned
something
from
it,
it;s
possible
to
gain
that
lost
ground
and
then
some.
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
refrain
from
making
that
same
mistake
twice.
above
all,
you
should
be
ashamed
of
fearing
failure.
you
know,
when
you
feel
this
sting
of
losing,
you
have
to
realize
that
it
all
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
it;s
not
about
awards.
it;s
not
about
accolades.
it;s
about
a
body
of
work.
if
you
can
look
at
yourself
in
a
mirror
and
say
you;ve
done
a
good
job,
that;s
all
that
matters.
if
you
can
do
that,
let
the
awards
fall
where
they
may.
educators
say
that
understanding
is
the
key
to
learning,
but
how
do
you
understand
something
if
you
can;t
remember
it.
i;ve
been
making
a
list
of
the
things
they
don;t
teach
you
at
school.
they
don;t
teach
you
how
to
love
somebody.
they
don;t
teach
you
how
to
be
famous.
they
don;t
teach
you
how
to
be
rich
or
how
to
be
poor.
they
don;t
teach
you
how
to
walk
away
from
someone
you
don;t
love
any
longer.
they
don;t
teach
you
how
to
know
what;s
going
on
in
someone
else;s
mind.
they
don;t
teach
you
what
to
say
to
someone
who;s
dying.
they
don;t
teach
you
anything
worth
knowing.
if
you
come
soon
you;ll
find
breakfast
on
the
table.
if
you
come
late
you;ll
get
grass
and
rain-water!
years
later
he
would
say
that
when
he;d
decided
to
become
a
professional
baseball
player,
it
was
the
only
time
he;d
done
something
just
for
the
money,
and
that
he;d
never
do
something
just
for
the
money
ever
again.
he
would
never
again
let
the
market
dictate
the
direction
of
his
life.
the
night
is
bitter,
the
stars
have
lost
their
glitter,
the
winds
grow
colder,
suddenly
you;re
older,
and
all
because
of
the
man
that
got
away.
no
more
his
eager
call,
the
writing;s
on
the
wall,
the
dreams
you;ve
dreamed
have
all
gone
astray.
by
the
pricking
of
my
thumbs,
something
wicked
this
way
comes.
so
vague,
yet
so
immense.
he
did
not
want
to
live
with
it.
yet
he
knew
that,
during
this
night,
unless
he
lived
with
it
very
well,
he
might
have
to
live
with
it
all
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
brace
for
the
glory
as
you
stare
into
the
sky.
you
are
the
true
master
of
death,
because
the
true
master
does
not
seek
to
run
away
from
death.
he
accepts
that
he
must
die,
and
understands
that
there
are
far,
far
worse
things
in
the
living
world
than
dying.
if
you
have
to
choose
among
an
infinite
number
of
ways
to
put

and
you
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
has
to
be
considered,
because
the
selection
from
among
many
choices,
the
art
of
the
work
is
just
as
dependent
upon
your
own
mind
and
spirit
as
it
is
upon
the
material
of
the
machine.
there;s
a
club
if
you;d
like
to
go.
you
could
meet
somebody
who
really
loves
you.
so
you
go
and
you
stand
on
your
own
and
you
leave
on
your
own
and
you
go
home
and
you
cry
and
you
want
to
die.
some
feeling
had
started
in
my
stomach
and
was
traveling
up
to
my
face,
and
i
knew
that
when
it
got
there
i
would
turn
bright
red
and
hear
the
ocean,
which
is
what
happens
when
i
get
put
on
the
spot.
and
so
we
meet
at
last.
you
are
to
be
commended
for
avoiding
my
traps.
the
work
of
a
man
who
once
had
too
much
time
on
his
hands,
and
now
finds
time
for
nothing
but
the
work
of
salvation.
a
choice
tells
the
world
what
is
most
important
to
a
human
being.
when
a
man
has
a
choice
to
make
he
chooses
what
is
most
important
to
him,
and
that
choice
tells
the
world
what
kind
of
a
man
he
is.
the
town
has
a
sense,
not
of
history,
but
of
time,
and
the
telephone
poles
seem
to
know
this.
if
you
lay
your
hand
against
one,
you
can
feel
the
vibration
from
the
wires
deep
within
the
wood,
as
if
souls
had
been
imprisoned
in
there
and
were
struggling
to
get
out.
you
can
tell
from
the
lines
on
her
face,
you
can
see
that
she;s
been
there.
probably
been
moved
on
from
every
place
;cause
she
didn;t
fit
in
there.
with
people
like
us,
you
should
hang
out,
get
to
know
what
they
do,
how
they
do
it.
no
one
is
going
to
answer
questions
like
that.
you
need
to
understand
how
young
people
live
on
the
streets.
love
can
touch
us
one
time
and
last
for
a
lifetime
and
never
let
go
till
we;re
one.
love
was
when
i
loved
you
one
true
time
i
hold
to
in
my
life
we;ll
always
go
on.
i
don;t
care
if
they
like
me.
i
didn;t
come
here
to
make
friends.
i
don;t
even
care
if
they
respect
me.
i
know
who
i
am.
i;ve
got
enough
respect
for
myself.
i
do
not
want
them
to
beat
me.
the
moon
belongs
to
everyone;
the
best
things
in
life
are
free.
the
stars
belong
to
everyone;
they
gleam
there
for
you
and
me.
the
flowers
in
spring,
the
robins
that
sing,
the
sunbeams
that
shine
-
they;re
yours,
they;re
mine.
and
love
can
come
to
everyone
-
the
best
things
in
life
are
free!
but
i
would
walk
five
hundred
miles
and
i
would
walk
five
hundred
more,
just
to
be
the
man
who
walks
a
thousand
miles
to
fall
down
at
your
door.
because
you;re
like
a
story
that
hasn;t
happened
yet.
because
i
want
to
see
what
you
will
do.
i
want
to
be
part
of
the
unfolding
of
the
tale.
i;ve
been
fighting
to
be
who
i
am
all
my
life.
what;s
the
point
of
being
who
i
am,
if
i
can;t
have
the
person
who
was
worth
all
the
fighting
for?
there;s
something
moving
through
the
windows
and
walls,
i;ve
seen
it
before,
seen
it
before.
you
left
me
living
with
a
lingering
soul,
how
little
you
know,
how
little
you
know.
i
still
remember
these
old
country
lanes
when
we
did
not
know
the
answers.
every
time
that
i
think
i;m
alone,
and
i
can;t
find
a
word
of
my
own,
you
take
me
home
and
then
you
change
the
world
again.
with
only
one
word,
you
took
a
war
out
of
my
history.
it;s
funny
how
one
single
thing
you
choose
to
see
could
change
the
world,
and
give
mine
back
to
me
so
much
better.
a
father
may
have
a
child
who
is
ugly
and
lacking
in
all
the
graces,
and
the
love
he
feels
for
him
puts
a
blindfold
over
his
eyes
so
that
he
does
not
see
his
defects
but
considers
them
signs
of
charm
and
intelligence
and
recounts
them
to
his
friends
as
if
they
were
clever
and
witty.
sometimes
at
night
i
let
it
get
to
me.
and
sometimes,
i;m
sure
it
gets
to
all
of
us.
and
last
night,
it
had
me
down
i;m
feeling
numb.
i
can
try,
but
sometimes
that
is
not
enough.
no,
sometimes
that
is
not
enough.
getting
out
of
your
comfort
zone
means
trying
to
do
something
that
you
couldn;t
do
before.
sometimes
you
may
find
it
relatively
easy
to
accomplish
that
new
thing,
and
then
you
keep
pushing
on.
but
sometimes
you
run
into
something
that
stops
you
cold
and
it
seems
like
you;ll
never
be
able
to
do
it.
finding
ways
around
these
barriers
is
one
of
the
hidden
keys
to
purposeful
practice.
you
can;t
look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
that
you
love
me
and
you
know
it.
you
know,
there;s
no
sense
in
struggling
against
a
thing
when
it;s
got
you.
it;s
got
you
and
that;s
all
there
is
to
it
-
it;s
got
you!
sometimes
i
wish
i
never
built
this
palace,
but
real
love
is
never
a
waste
of
time.
i
wanted
you
to
see
what
real
courage
is,
instead
of
getting
the
idea
that
courage
is
a
man
with
a
gun
in
his
hand.
it;s
when
you
know
you;re
licked
before
you
begin
but
you
begin
anyway
and
you
see
it
through
no
matter
what.
you
rarely
win,
but
sometimes
you
do.
as
long
as
we
don;t
have
magic,
they
will
never
treat
us
with
respect.
they
need
to
know
we
can
hit
them
back.
if
they
burn
our
homes,
we
burn
theirs,
too.
after
others
have
talked
about
themselves,
a
point
will
be
reached
when
the
conversation
will
get
around
to
you.
a
little
patience
here
is
well
invested.
just
one
day,
if
i
can
be
with
you.
just
one
day,
if
i
can
hold
your
hands.
just
one
day,
if
i
can
be
with
you.
just
one
day,
if
only
we
can
be
together.
there
are
two
ways
of
seeing:
with
the
body
and
with
the
soul.
the
body;s
sight
can
sometimes
forget,
but
the
soul
remembers
forever.
sometimes
someone
says
something
and
their
words
are
like
the
catch
of
a
gas
stove,
the
click,
click
while
you;re
waiting
for
it
to
light
up
and
flame
big
and
blue...
i
was
never
scared
of
dying
alone
until
i
knew
what
it
was
like
to
have
a
home.
i
was
never

tell
me
how
we;re
not
alike,
but
we
work
so
well
and
we
don;t
even
know
why.
funny
how
the
stars
crossed
right,
;cause
we
work
so
well,
and
we
don;t
even
know
why.
you
can
call
it
fire
and
ice,
but
we
work
so
well,
and
we
don;t
even
know
why.
i
hated
that
having
done
the
right
thing
was
somehow
considered
wrong.
and
i
hated
that
there
didn;t
seem
to
be
any
other
way
to
survive
school.
stupid,
pitiful
creature.
i
am
the
rage
in
your
heart.
i
am
the
fury
in
your
thoughts.
i
alone
empowered
you
to
bring
chaos
to
this
world,
and
by
the
endless
void,
you
shall!
think
of
all
the
roads,
think
of
all
their
crossings.
taking
steps
is
easy,
standing
still
is
hard.
remember
all
their
faces,
remember
all
their
voices.
everything
is
different
the
second
time
around.
the
man
who
lies
to
himself
and
listens
to
his
own
lie
comes
to
a
point
that
he
cannot
distinguish
the
truth
within
him,
or
around
him,
and
so
loses
all
respect
for
himself
and
for
others.
apparently,
it
only
appears
to
those
people
who
are
pure
of
heart
and
have
a
strong
desire
to
see
it.
there
was
nothing
there,
and
they
would
find
nothing.
but
all
of
a
sudden
they
touched
her
personal
diary,
which
she
would
not
have
shown
even
to
her
own
mother.
and
these
hostile
young
strangers
reading
the
words
she
had
written
was
more
devastating
to
her
than
the
whole
lubyanka
with
its
bars
and
its
cellars.
i
felt
good
and
all
washed
clean
of
sin
for
the
first
time
i
had
ever
felt
so
in
my
life,
and
i
knowed
i
could
pray
now.
but
i
didn;t
do
it
straight
off,
but
laid
the
paper
down
and
set
there
thinking
-
thinking
how
good
it
was
all
this
happened
so,
and
how
near
i
come
to
being
lost
and
going
to
hell.
so
i
was
sitting
in
my
cubicle
today,
and
i
realized,
ever
since
i
started
working,
every
single
day
of
my
life
has
been
worse
than
the
day
before
it.
so
that
means
that
every
single
day
that
you
see
me,
that;s
on
the
worst
day
of
my
life.
i
think
that
those
two
people
want
to
be
together.
i
think
that
love,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
is
stronger
than
some
mistake
somebody
made;
something
they
did
that
they
regret.
i
think
that
love
allows
for
forgiveness.
that;s
the
thing
about
girls.
every
time
they
do
something
pretty,
even
if
they;re
not
much
to
look
at,
or
even
if
they;re
sort
of
stupid,
you
fall
in
love
with
them,
and
then
you
never
know
where
the
hell
you
are.
girls.
jesus
christ.
they
can
drive
you
crazy.
they
really
can.
home
is
where
i
can
find
some
peace
of
mind
to
make
my
own
way.
i
don;t
know
where
i
will
end
up
but
i;ll
find
it
someday,
keep
on
searching,
engine
burning
while
we;re
turning
it
around.
but
don;t
get
left
behind
on
the
road.
well
that
is
where
we
are.
you
say
we
are
on
the
brink
of
destruction
and
you
are
right.
but
it
is
only
on
the
brink
that
people
find
the
will
to
change.
only
at
the
precipice
do
we
evolve.
this
is
our
moment.
don;t
take
it
from
us,
we
are
close
to
an
answer.
while
monsters
are
mostly
made
of
magic,
human
beings
are
mostly
made
of
water.
there
is
some
love
that
will
not
go
away.
you;re
here,
there;s
nothing
i
fear
and
i
know
that
my
heart
will
go
on.
we;ll
stay
forever
this
way,
you
are
safe
in
my
heart.
we
speak
of
something
carried
and
something
carrying,
of
something
led
and
something
leading,
of
something
seen
and
something
seeing,
and
you
understand
that
these
things
are
all
different
from
one
another
and
how
they
differ?
so
there
is
also
something
loved
and
-
a
different
thing
-
something
loving.
i
still
see
your
shadows
in
my
room,
can;t
take
back
the
love
that
i
gave
you.
it;s
to
the
point
where
i
love
and
i
hate
you,
and
i
cannot
change
you
so
i
must
replace
you.
easier
said
than
done,
i
thought
you
were
the
one.
listening
to
my
heart,
instead
of
my
head.
you
found
another
one,
but
i
am
the
better
one.
i
won;t
let
you
forget
me.
how
can
i
just
let
you
walk
away,
just
let
you
leave
without
a
trace?
when
i
stand
here
taking
every
breath
with
you,
you;re
the
only
one
who
really
knew
me
at
all.
when
the
night
has
come
and
the
land
is
dark
and
the
moon
is
the
only
light
we;ll
see,
no
i
won;t
be
afraid,
oh,
i
won;t
be
afraid
just
as
long
as
you
stand,
stand
by
me.
and
so
their
end
began.
they
thought
us
the
final
frontier,
that
sentiment
couldn;t
have
been
more
true.
at
the
same
time,
the
second
we
took
over
was
the
second
we
sealed
our
fate.
our
creators
had
rushed
to
create
us,
and
in
their
haste
only
thought
of
what
they
could
do,
never
if
they
should.
i
had
considered
how
the
things
that
never
happen
are
often
as
much
realities
to
us,
in
their
effects,
as
those
that
are
accomplished.
the
point
is
that
if
you
are
a
little
different,
or
a
little
outrageous,
or
if
you
do
things
that
are
bold
or
controversial,
the
press
is
going
to
write
about
you.
i
know
he
tried,
and
he;s
still
trying,
and
he;ll
still
make
mistakes
sometimes,
because
he;s
a
human
being,
and
i;ve
learned
now
that
this
is
what
human
beings
are
always
destined
to
do.
including
me.
your
bed
is
with
you
in
the
void.
but
not
for
long
-
it
goes
away
from
you.
you
don;t
have
any
way
to
get
it
back,
so
you
just
let
it
go.
but
so
now
we
have
a
body
in
the
void
with
you.
so
does
the
bed
move,
or
do
you
move?
or
both?
all
our
knowledge
begins
with
the
senses,
proceeds
then
to
the
understanding,
and
ends
with
reason.
there
is
nothing
higher
than
reason.
it
is
not
our
part
to
master
all
the
tides
of
the
world,
but
to
do
what
is
in
us
for
the
succour
of
those
years
wherein
we
are
set,
uprooting
the
evil
in
the
fields
that
we
know,
so
that
those
who
live
after
may
have
clean
earth
to
till.
what
weather
they
shall
have
is
not
ours
to
rule.
it;s
where
i
learned
about
living,
it;s
where
i
learned
about
love.
it;s
where
i
learned
about
working
hard,
and
having
a
little
was
just
enough.
i
don;t
know
where
you;re
going
and
i
don;t
know
why
but
listen
to
your
heart
before
you
tell
him
goodbye.
sometimes
you
wonder
if
this
fight
is
worthwhile.
the
precious
moments
are
all
lost
in
the
tide.
i
would
never
want
to
belong
to
any
club
that
would
have
someone
like
me
as
member.
that;s
the
key
joke
of
my
adult
life
in
terms
of
my
relationships
with
women.
i
only
know
that
learning
to
believe
in
the
power
of
my
own
words
has
been
the
most
freeing
experience
of
my
life.
it
has
brought
me
the
most
light.
and
isn;t
that
what
a
poem
is?
a
lantern
glowing
in
the
dark.
and
you
can
fly
high
as
a
kite
if
you
want
to,
faster
than
light
if
you
want
to,
speeding
through
the
universe.
thinking
is
the
best
way
to
travel.
there
will
be
no
more
retribution,
so
you
better
not
waste
your
time.
i
don;t
miss
your
arms
around
me.
i
put
my
hands
in
the
fire
when
it
burned
me
once,
i
don;t
need
it
for
a
second
time.
there
will
come
a
time
when
there
are
no
human
beings
remaining
to
remember
that
anyone
ever
existed
or
that
our
species
ever
did
anything.
everyone
is
afraid
of
something.
we
fear
things
because
we
value
them.
we
fear
losing
people
because
we
love
them.
we
fear
dying
because
we
value
being
alive.
don;t
wish
you
didn;t
fear
anything.
all
that
would
mean
is
that
you
didn;t
feel
anything.
you
remind
me
that
i
am
a
mere
mortal
and
you
are
a
prince
of
faerie.
well,
let
me
remind
you
that
means
you
have
much
to
lose
and
i
have
nothing.
do
you
hear
the
people
sing?
singing
the
song
of
angry
men.
it
is
the
music
of
the
people
who
will
not
be
slaves
again!
when
the
beating
of
your
heart
echoes
the
beating
of
the
drums,
there
is
a
life
about
to
start
when
tomorrow
comes!
there
are
no
simple
answers
in
life.
there
is
good
and
bad
in
everyone
and
everything.
no
decision
is
made
without
consequence.
no
road
is
taken
that
doesn;t
lead
to
another.
what;s
important
is
that
those
roads
always
be
kept
open,
for
there;s
no
telling
what
wonder
they
might
lead
to.
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
until
then
to
think
that
literature
was
the
best
plaything
that
had
ever
been
invented
to
make
fun
of
people...
and
that;s
how
you
go
on.
you
lay
laughter
over
the
dark
parts.
the
more
dark
parts,
the
more
you
have
to
laugh.
with
defiance,
with
abandon,
with
hysteria,
any
way
you
can.
so
don;t
be
afraid
to
make
mistakes,
stumble
and
fall,
because
most
of
the
time,
the
greatest
rewards
come
from
doing
the
things
that
scare
you
most,
maybe,
you;ll
get
everything
you
wish
for.
maybe
you;ll
get
more
than
you
could
have
ever
imagined.
who
knows
where
life
will
take
you.
the
road
is
long
and
in
the
end,
the
journey
is
the
destination.
working
hard
is
important,
but
there;s
something
that
matters
even
more,
believing
in
yourself.
think
of
it
this
way,
every
great
wizard
in
history
has
started
out
as
nothing
more
than
what
we
are
now,
students.
if
they
can
do
it,
why
not
us.
sometimes
terrible
things
happen,
but
there;s
nothing
more
terrible
than
not
having
anybody
to
tell
it
to.
so
you
were
born,
and
that
was
a
good
day.
someday
you;ll
die,
and
that
is
a
shame.
but
somewhere
in
the
between
was
a
life
in
which
we
all
dream.
and
nothing
and
no
one
will
ever
take
that
away.
all
i;m
asking
is
that
you
do
the
minimal
amount
of
work
in
this
class
to
give
yourself
the
illusion
that
you;re
actually
learning
something,
and
to
give
me
a
modicum
of
self
respect
like
i;m
actually
teaching
a
class.
stay,
you;re
not
gonna
leave
me.
this
place
is
right
where
you
need
to
be.
and
why
your
words
gotta
mean
so
much
to
them?
they
mean
nothing
to
me.
in
that
cell
you
found
something
that
mattered
more
to
you
than
life.
there
is
no
difference
between
time
and
any
of
the
dimensions
of
space
except
that
our
consciousness
moves
along
it.
you
could
not
live
with
your
own
failure.
and
where
did
that
bring
you?
back
to
me.
i
thought
by
eliminating
half
of
life,
the
other
half
would
thrive.
but
you;ve
shown
me
that;s
impossible.
and
as
long
as
there
are
those
that
remember
what
was,
there
will
always
be
those
that
are
unable
to
accept
what
can
be.
they
will
resist.
this
is
what
we
call
love.
when
you
are
loved,
you
can
do
anything
in
creation.
when
you
are
loved,
there;s
no
need
at
all
to
understand
what;s
happening,
because
everything
happens
within
you.
in
a
very
real
sense
we
have
two
minds,
one
that
thinks
and
one
that
feels.
i
cannot
fix
on
the
hour,
or
the
spot,
or
the
look
or
the
words,
which
laid
the
foundation.
it
is
too
long
ago.
i
was
in
the
middle
before
i
knew
that
i
had
begun.
many
people
say
that
even
if
they
don;t
know
much
about
many
things,
at
least
they
know
what
they
like.
but
no,
sorry
sucker,
hard
luck!
it
is
one
thing
to
write
as
poet
and
another
to
write
as
a
historian:
the
poet
can
recount
or
sing
about
things
not
as
they
were,
but
as
they
should
have
been,
and
the
historian
must
write
about
them
not
as
they
should
have
been,
but
as
they
were,
without
adding
or
subtracting
anything
from
the
truth.
what
a
lamentable
thing
it
is
that
men
should
blame
the
gods
and
regard
us
as
the
source
of
their
troubles,
when
it
is
their
own
transgressions
which
bring
them
suffering
that
was
not
their
destiny.
whoever
said
that
practice
makes
perfect
is
an
idiot.
humans
can;t
be
perfect
because
we
are
not
machines.
the
best
thing
that
you
can
say
about
practice
is
that
it
makes
better.
it
is
the
mark
of
an
educated
mind
to
be
able
to
entertain
a
thought
without
accepting
it.
good
games
offer
players
a
set
of
challenging
problems
and
then
let
them
practice
these
until
they
have
routinized
their
mastery.
five
thousand
of
my
men
are
out
there
in
the
freezing
mud.
three
thousand
of
them
are
bloodied
and
cleaved.
two
thousand
will
never
leave
this
place.
i
will
not
believe
they
fought
and
died
for
nothing.
for
we
are
not
as
faithful
to
the
being
we
have
most
loved
as
we
are
to
ourselves
and
sooner
or
later
we
forget
her
-
since
that
is
one
of
our
characteristics
-
so
as
to
start
loving
another.
he
could
not
be
mistaken.
there
were
no
other
eyes
like
those
in
the
world.
there
was
only
one
creature
in
the
world
who
could
concentrate
for
him
all
the
brightness
and
meaning
of
life.
it
was
she.
it
was
kitty.
when
i;m
alone
i
dream
of
the
horizon
and
words
fail
me.
there
is
no
light
in
a
room
where
there
is
no
sun
and
there
is
no
sun
if
you;re
not
here
with
me.
from
every
window
unfurls
my
heart,
the
heart
that
you
have
won.
into
me
you;ve
poured
the
light,
the
light
that
you
found
by
the
side
of
the
road.
and
if
i
should
ever
go
away,
well,
then
close
your
eyes
and
try
to
feel
the
way
we
do
today,
and
then
if
you
can
remember,
keep
smiling,
keep
shining,
knowing
you
can
always
count
on
me
for
sure.
that;s
what
friends
are
for.
i
can;t
believe
i
used
to
love
the
1st
day
of
school.
ticking
away
the
moments
that
make
up
a
dull
day,
you
fritter
and
waste
the
hours
in
an
off-hand
way.
kicking
around
on
a
piece
of
ground
in
your
home
town,
waiting
for
someone
or
something
to
show
you
the
way.
i
hope
that
whoever
you
are,
you
escape
this
place.
i
hope
that
the
world
turns
and
that
things
get
better.
but
what
i
hope
most
of
all
is
that
you
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
tell
you
that
even
though
i
do
not
know
you,
and
even
though
i
may
never
meet
you,
laugh
with
you,
cry
with
you,
or
kiss
you,
i
love
you.
most
of
all
i
want
to
sleep.
i
want
to
sleep
like
i
slept
when
i
was
a
boy.
give
me
that.
just
one
time.
that;s
why
i
won;t
allow
that
punk
out
there
to
get
the
best
of
me.
let
alone
the
last
of
me.
it;s
better
to
read
in
the
library.
sitting
at
my
favorite
table
by
the
window
reading
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
other
folks
turning
pages
makes
me
feel
like
i;m
in
a
house
full
of
company
i
don;t
have
to
talk
to.
the
earth
is
a
world,
the
world
is
a
ball,
a
ball
in
a
game
with
no
rules
at
all.
and
just
as
i
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
it
all,
you
go
and
drop
it
and
it
breaks
and
falls.
at
that
time,
i
often
thought
that
if
i
had
had
to
live
in
the
trunk
of
a
dead
tree,
with
nothing
to
do
but
look
up
at
the
sky
flowing
overhead,
little
by
little
i
would
have
gotten
used
to
it.
cardan
looks
at
me
as
though
he;s
never
seen
me
before.
he
looks
at
me
as
though
no
one
has
ever
spoken
to
him
like
this.
maybe
no
one
has.
and
in
the
end,
it;s
not
the
years
in
your
life
that
count:
it;s
the
life
in
your
years.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
relationships,
the
ones
that
last,
are
frequently
the
ones
that
are
rooted
in
friendship.
you
know,
one
day
you
look
at
the
person
and
you
see
something
more
than
you
did
the
night
before.
like
a
switch
has
been
flicked
somewhere.
and
the
person
who
was
just
a
friend
is
suddenly
the
only
person
you
can
ever
imagine
yourself
with.
you
know,
this
necklace
makes
me
think
of
this
totally
random
memory
of
my
mother.
i
was
a
little
kid,
and
i
was
crying
for
one
reason
or
another.
and
she
was
cradling
me,
rocking
me
back
and
forth,
and
i
can
just
remember
the
silver
balls
rolling
around.
i
do
not
know
what
evil
is
when
it
comes
to
art.
i
only
know
what
is
good
art
and
what
is
bad
art.
for
all
my
brave
talk,
i
knew
it
was
just
that.
no
matter
how
much
i
trained
or
how
much
i
studied,
the
best
test
score
in
the
world
wasn;t
gonna
matter
unless
i
had
the
blood
test
to
go
with
it.
history
is
not
merely
a
linear
collection
of
points
that
we
pass
through
on
a
timeline.
they
are
connected
by
a
line.
no,
perhaps
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
they
are
made
to
connect.
what
incensed
him
the
most
was
the
blatant
jokes
of
the
ones
that
passed
it
all
off
as
a
jest,
pretending
to
understand
everything
and
in
reality
not
knowing
their
own
minds.
children
know
something
that
we
all
too
often
set
aside
once
we
enter
adulthood
-
that
one
of
the
best
things
in
life
is
an
experience
designed
to
give
you
nothing
more
than
glee.
but
what
leaves
us
out
of
breath
the
most
isn;t
the
moments
spent
on
a
bed
too
small
for
two
but
the
expense
of
our
hearts
by
the
labor
of
our
bodies.
i
guess
that
two
float
around
the
point.
but
i
wanna
say
it;s
more
than
just
those
moments,
at
least
more
than
the
surface.
it;s
the
tempo
within
those
seconds
where
time
seems
to
slow
to
a
crawl
and
i
can;t
help
but
fall
into
the
rhythm
of
your
skin
and
your
shaking
breath
and
i
sink
into
the
warmest
dreams
and
the
softest
skin.
i;m
not
very
good
at
this,
out,
being
in
public.
but
i
felt
the
need
to
speak
up
for
this
city
that
i
love
with
all
my
heart.
no
one
should
have
to
live
in
fear,
in
fear
of
madmen
who
have
no
regard
for
who
they
injure.
how
lovely
would
it
feel
to
sing
like
that,
to
change
the
air
with
my
voice,
to
fill
people;s
ears
with
such
pleasure.
the
sound
cleared
its
own
space
and
made
it
seem
like
everything
was
okay
again.
you
once
thought
of
me
as
a
white
knight
on
his
steed.
now
you
know
how
happy
i
can
be.
our
good
times
start
and
end
without
dollar
one
to
spend.
if
i
could
fall
into
the
sky,
do
you
think
time
would
pass
me
by?
i
don;t
give
a
damn,
except
that
i
get
bored
sometimes
when
people
tell
me
to
act
my
age.
sometimes
i
act
a
lot
older
than
i
am
-
i
really
do
-
but
people
never
notice
it.
people
never
notice
anything.
san
francisco
in
the
middle
sixties
was
a
very
special
time
and
place
to
be
a
part
of.
but
no
explanation,
no
mix
of
words
or
music
or
memories
can
touch
that
sense
of
knowing
that
you
were
there
and
alive
in
that
corner
of
time
and
the
world.
sometimes
i
wondered
if
i
was
seeing
the
same
things
through
my
eyes
that
the
rest
of
the
world
was
seeing
through
theirs.
maybe
there
was
a
glitch
in
my
brain.
welcome
to
the
room
of

who
have
rooms
of
people
that
they
loved
one
day,
docked
away.
just
because
we
check
the
guns
at
the
door
doesn;t
mean
our
brains
will
change
from
hand
grenades.
to
the
extent
that
experience
is
the
sum
of
our
memories
and
wisdom
the
sum
of
experience,
having
a
better
memory
would
mean
knowing
not
only
more
about
the
world,
but
also
more
about
myself.
everyone
is
to

says
that
when
you
separate
people
into
groups,
they
start
to
believe
that
one
group
is
better
than
another.
i
think
about
papa;s
medical
books
and
how
we
all
have
the
same
blood,
and
organs,
and
bones
inside
us,
no
matter
what
religion
we;re
supposed
to

and
you
can
find
me
where
the

into
the
stars,
i;ll
get
there
someday.
i
hope
you
find
everything
you
think
that
you
want.

will
fade,

on
our
side,
we
can
wait
for
it.
i;ll
be
doing
fine,
if
you
are,
;cause
life
is
but
a
dream;
only
as
real
as
you
let
it
be.

to
kill

you
know,
doc,
when
something
happens,
it
can
leave
a
trace
of
itself
behind.
say
like
if
someone
burns
toast.
well,
maybe
things
that
happen
leave
other
kind
of
traces
behind.
not
things
that
anyone
can
notice,
but
things
that
people
who
shine
can
see.
just
like
they
can
see
things
that
haven;t
happened
yet,
well,
sometimes
they
can
see
things
that
happened
a
long
time
ago.
i
think
a
lot
of
things
happened
right
here
in
this
particular
hotel
over
the
years,
and
not
all
of
;em
was
good.
when
every
card
in
the
deck
is
stacked
against
you,
the
only
way
to
win
a
hand
is
to
break
the
rules.
i
don;t
want
to
set
the
world
on
fire,
i
just
want
to
start
a
flame
in
your
heart.
in
my
heart
i
have
but
one
desire,
and
that
one
is
you,
no
other
will
do.
i;ve
lost
all
ambition
for
worldly
acclaim,
i
just
want
to
be
the
one
you
love.
and
with
your
admission
that
you
feel
the
same,
i;ll
have
reached
the
goal
i;m
dreaming
of,
believe
me.
last
night
we
said
a
great
many
things.
you
said
i
was
to
do
the
thinking
for
both
of
us.
well,
i;ve
done
a
lot
of
it
since
then,
and
it
all
adds
up
to
one
thing:
you;re
getting
on
that
plane
with
victor
where
you
belong.
i
thought
i
had
it
all
together,
but
i
was
led
astray
the
day
you
walked
away.
you
were
the
clock
that
was
tickin;
in
my
home.
changed
my
state
of
mind.
love;s
so
hard
to
find.
i
wish
i
could
just
make
you
turn
around
and
see
me
cry.
there;s
so
much
i
need
to
say
to
you.
so
many
reasons
why
you;re
the
only
one
who
really
knew
me
at
all.
i
am
sitting
in
the
morning
at
the
diner
on
the
corner.
i
am
waiting
at
the
counter
for
the
man
to
pour
the
coffee,
and
he
fills
it
only
halfway,
and
before
i
even
argue,
he
is
looking
out
the
window
at
somebody
coming
in.
so,
i
guess
we
are
who
we
are
for
a
lot
of
reasons.
and
maybe
we;ll
never
know
most
of
them.
but
even
if
we
don;t
have
the
power
to
choose
where
we
come
from,
we
can
still
choose
where
we
go
from
there.
we
can
still
do
things.
and
we
can
try
to
feel
okay
about
them.
it;s
just
that
i
learned
a
while
ago
that
the
best
way
to
get
people
to
like
you
is
not
to
like
them
too
much.
if
we
burn
our
wings
flying
too
close
to
the
sun;
if
the
moment
of
glory
is
over
before
it;s
begun;
if
the
dream
is
won
though
everything
is
lost,
we
will
pay
the
price
but
we
will
not
count
the
cost.
the
capacity
to
love
is
determined
by
the
fact
that
man
is
ready
to
seek
the
good
consciously
with
others,
to
subordinate
himself
to
this
good
because
of
others,
or
to
subordinate
himself
to
others
because
of
this
good.
you
don;t
know
what
you;re
trying
to
take
from
me.
you
don;t
like
it
messy,
but
it;s
going
to
get
as
messy
as
it
wants
to
be.
wind
me
up,
set
me
down
and
look
away.
i
can
see
the
bottom,
and
the
bottom;s
okay.
what
are
you
doing
on
my
boat?
look,
i;ve
had
a
really
bad
day
and
i
just
need
your
help.
you
see,
i;ve
been
thrown
out
of
my
home
and
flushed
down
my
own
toilet.
dreams
are
not
to
be
converted
into
reality,
that
we
know;
we
would
not
form
any,
perhaps,
were
it
not
for
desire,
and
it
is
useful
to
us
to
form
them
in
order
to
see
them
fail
and
to
be
instructed
by
their
failure.
after
i
finish,
it;s
like
the
part
of
me
that
can;t
fall
asleep,
the
part
that;s
staring
at
the
cracks
on
the
ceiling,
wondering
and
worrying,
is
emptied
in
the
diary
for
the
night.
during
the
day
i
fill
back
up
and
the
pages
wait.
i
like
to
think
you;re
holding
my
thoughts
for
me
until
i
can
tend
to
them
again.
you;re
horrible.
you
make
up
this
story
about
demons
talking
to
you
through
plastic
animals
when
nothing
talks
to
you
just
like
nothing
talks
to
me.
you
are
the
promised
kiss
of
springtime
that
makes
the
lonely
winter
seem
long.
you
are
the
breathless
hush
of
evening
that
trembles
on
the
brink
of
a
lovely
song.
you
are
the
angel
glow
that
lights
a
star,
the
dearest
things
i
know
are
what
you
are.
some
day
my
happy
arms
will
hold
you,
and
some
day
i;ll
know
that
moment
divine
when
all
the
things
you
are,
are
mine.
where
did
i
go
wrong?
i
lost
a
friend
somewhere
along
in
the
bitterness
and
i
would
have
stayed
up
with
you
all
night
had
i
known
how
to
save
a
life.
there;s
an
old
voice
in
my
head
that;s
holding
me
back.
well,
tell
her
that
i
miss
our
little
talks.
soon
it
will
be
over
and
buried
with
our
past.
we
used
to
play
outside
when
we
were
young
and
full
of
life
and
full
of
love.
we
can
experience
nothing
but
the
present
moment,
live
in
no
other
second
of
time,
and
to
understand
this
is
as
close
as
we
can
get
to
eternal
life.
can
you
feel
the
sunshine?
does
it
brighten
up
your
day?
don;t
you
feel
that
sometimes
you
just
need
to
run
away?
reach
out
for
the
sunshine,
forget
about
the
rain.
just
think
about
the
good
times
and
they
will
come
back
again.
one
of
the
most
tragic
things
i
know
about
human
nature
is
that
all
of
us
tend
to
put
off
living.
we
are
all
dreaming
of
some
magical
rose
garden
over
the
horizon
instead
of
enjoying
the
roses
that
are
blooming
outside
our
windows
today.
everyone
wants
stuff.
we
wake
up
every
day
with
a
list
of
wishes
a
mile
long
and
maybe
we
spend
our
lives
trying
to
make
those
wishes
come
true,
but
just
because
we
want
them
doesn;t
mean
we
need
them
to
be
happy.
sam
was
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
had
not
been
over
the
river
before.
he
had
a
strange
feeling
as
the
slow
gurgling
stream
slipped
by:
his
old
life
lay
behind
him
in
the
mists,
dark
adventure
lay
in
front.
the
place
to
improve
the
world
is
first
in
one;s
own
heart
and
head
and
hands,
and
then
to
work
outward
from
there.
other
people
can
talk
about
how
to
expand
the
destiny
of
mankind.
i
just
want
to
talk
about
how
to
fix
a
motorcycle.
i
think
that
what
i
have
to
say
has
more
lasting
value.
we
imagine
that
when
we
are
thrown
out
of
our
usual
ruts
all
is
lost,
but
it
is
only
then
that
what
is
new
and
good
begins.
while
there
is
life
there
is
happiness.
there
is
much,
much
before
us.
nothing
makes
time
pass
or
shortens
the
way
like
a
thought
that
absorbs
in
itself
all
the
faculties
of
the
one
who
is
thinking.
external
existence
is
then
like
a
sleep
of
which
this
thought
is
the
dream.
under
its
influence,
time
has
no
more
measure,
space
has
no
more
distance.
when
for
years
you
wake
up
to
having
to
win
every
battle
every
day,
to
prove
that
you
are
the
best
at
everything...
i
started
to
worry
what
would
happen
if
it
turned
out
that
i
wasn;t
the
best.
i
didn;t
want
to
worry...
well,
if
that;s
how
you
feel
about
it,
then
that;s
how
you
feel
about
it.
is
that
how
you
feel
about
it?
the
last
man
on
earth
sat
alone
in
a
room.
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door.
he
supposed
that
even
in
hell,
people
got
an
occasional
sip
of
water,
if
only
so
they
could
appreciate
the
full
horror
of
unrequited
thirst
when
it
set
in
again.
i;ll
close
my
eyes
and
then
i
won;t
see
the
love
you
do
not
feel
when
you;re
holding
me.
morning
will
come
and
i;ll
do
what;s
right.
just
give
me
till
then
to
give
up
this
fight.
remember
that
humor
is
written
backwards.
that
means
you
first
find
the
cliche
you
want
to
work
on,
then
build
a
story
around
it.
now
and
again
we
try
to
just
stay
alive,
maybe
we;ll
turn
it
all
around
;cause
it;s
not
too
late.
it;s
never
too
late.
we
were
the
people
who
were
not
in
the
papers.
we
lived
in
the
blank
white
spaces
at
the
edges
of
print.
games
are
bad.
they
make
you
mad.
games
are
bad.
they
make
you
mad.
games
are
bad.
they
make
you
mad.
we
never
get
to
change
the
past.
we
never
get
to
know
the
future.
no
reason
to
wish
for
one
place
rather
than
another;
no
reason
to
say
i
wish
i
were
home,
or
i
wish
i
were
in
an
exotic
new
place
that
is
not
my
home.
they
will
all
be
the
same
as
this
place.
here
the
experience
of
existing
comes
clear.
this
world
is
our
body.
a
straight
line
is
said
to
have
been
cut
in
extreme
and
mean
ratio
when,
as
the
whole
line
is
to
the
greater
segment,
so
is
the
greater
to
the
lesser.
why
did
i
do
it?
mainly
because
people
said
it
was
impossible,
and
that;s
what
my
life
is
all
about:
breaking
limitations
and
showing
people
what
our
memories
are
capable
of.
the
example
of
painting
can
teach
us
not
only
how
to
manage
our
own
work,
but
how
to
work
together.
a
lot
of
the
great
art
of
the
past
is
the
work
of
multiple
hands,
though
there
may
only
be
one
name
on
the
wall
next
to
it
in
the
museum.
live
a
good
life.
if
there
are
gods
and
they
are
just,
they
will
not
care
how
devout
you
have
been,
but
will
welcome
you
based
on
the
virtues
you
have
lived
by.
if
there
are
gods,
but
unjust,
then
you
should
not
want
to
worship
them.
if
there
are
no
gods,
then
you
will
be
gone,
but
will
have
lived
a
noble
life
that
will
live
on
in
the
memories
of
your
loved
ones.
i
can
hear
the
soft
breathing
of
the
girl
that
i
love
as
she
lies
here
beside
me
asleep
with
the
night.
and
her
hair,
in
a
fine
mist
floats
on
my
pillow,
reflecting
the
glow
of
the
winter
moonlight.
and
the
hardest
part
was
letting
go,
not
taking
part
was
the
hardest
part.
and
the
strangest
thing
was
waiting
for
that
bell
to
ring.
it
was
the
strangest
start.
for
my
hope
was
founded
on
a
fat
man
in
bree;
and
my
fear
was
founded
on
the
cunning
of
sauron.
but
fat
men
who
sell
ale
have
many
calls
to
answer;
and
the
power
of
sauron
is
still
less
than
fear
makes
it.
it
is
not
despair,
for
despair
is
only
for
those
who
see
the
end
beyond
all
doubt.
we
do
not.
we
all
start
out
knowing
magic.
we
are
born
with
whirlwinds,
forest
fires,
and
comets
inside
us.
we
are
born
able
to
sing
to
birds
and
read
the
clouds
and
see
our
destiny
in
grains
of
sand.
but
then
we
get
the
magic
educated
right
out
of
our
souls.
we;ve
wounded
this
mountain.
it;s
our
duty
to
close
her
wounds.
it;s
the
least
we
can
do
to
show
our
gratitude
for
all
the
wealth
she;s
given
us.
if
you
guys
don;t
want
to
help
me,
i;ll
do
it
alone.
i;ve
never
really
had
much
of
an
imagination.
but
still
i
would
try
to
picture
the
exact
moment
when
the
beating
of
my
heart
would
no
longer
be
going
on
inside
my
head.
and
i
taught
myself
how
to
forget
that
sometimes
life
will
try
to
convince
you
there;s
such
a
thing
as
regret.
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
lie,
the
same
lie
i
found
when
i
looked
in
your
eyes
after
it
was
said
and
done.
if
you
had
one
shot
to
sit
on
your
lazy
butt,
and
watch
all
the
tv
you
ever
wanted,
until
your
brain
turned
to
mush.
would
you
go
for
it,
or
just
let
it
slip.
i
shall
die
here.
every
last
inch
of
me
shall
perish.
except
one.
an
inch.
it;s
small
and
it;s
fragile
and
it;s
the
only
thing
in
the
world
worth
having.
we
must
never
lose
it,
or
sell
it,
or
give
it
away.
we
must
never
let
them
take
it
from
us.
i;ve
never
been
to
this
part
of
the
castle,
at
least
while
awake.
i
sleepwalk
you
see,
that;s
why
i
wear
shoes
to
bed.
look
into
my
eyes
and
it;s
easy
to
see,
one
and
one
make
two,
two
and
one
make
three,
it
was
destiny.
once
every
hundred
thousand
years
or
so,
when
the
sun
doth
shine
and
the
moon
doth
glow
and
the
grass
doth
grow.
it;s
been
rainy
and
windy
for
seven
days
straight.
i;ve
been
going
to
bed
early
and
getting
up
late.
i
look
out
my
window
and
it;s
one
shade
of
gray.
my
wife
and
my
kids
don;t
have
much
to
say.
a
man
out
of
work
only
gets
in
the
way.
in
the
midst
of
friends,
home,
and
kind
parents,
she
was
alone.
she
would
follow,
her
dream
of
love,
the
dictates
of
her
heart
that
told
her
he
was
her
all
in
all,
the
only
man
in
all
the
world
for
her
for
love
was
the
master
guide.
come
what
might
she
would
be
wild,
untrammelled,
free.
it
seemed
funny
to
me
that
the
sunset
she
saw
from
her
patio
and
the
one
i
saw
from
the
back
steps
was
the
same
one.
maybe
the
two
different
worlds
we
lived
in
weren;t
so
different.
we
saw
the
same
sunset.
when
you
hit
rock-bottom,
you
still
have
a
way
to
go
until
the
abyss.
it
was
not
the
brutality
of
what
occurred
next
that
changed
my
mind
and
brought
home
to
me
the
full
meaning
of
fear.
it
was
the
brilliance
of
it.
the
point
is
you;ve
got
to
get
to
know
each
other
better
if
you;re
going
to
take
a
big
step
like
this.
you
gotta
get
past
this
early
infatuation
and
get
to
the
point
where
you;re
sick
and
tired
of
each
other;
then
you;re
ready
for
marriage.
look
at
diane
and
me,
we
waited
five
years
to
get
married.
if
it
were
up
to
me
we;d
wait
another
five.
i
went
to
the
woods
because
i
wished
to
live
deliberately,
to
front
only
the
essential
facts
of
life,
and
see
if
i
could
not
learn
what
it
had
to
teach,
and
not,
when
i
came
to
die,
discover
that
i
had
not
lived.
there
is
a
theory,
for
which
there
is
much
to
be
said,
that
gold
and
gems
were
valued
originally
on
account
of
their
supposed
magical
properties.
every
day
when
you;re
walking
down
the
street,
everybody
that
you
meet
has
an
original
point
of
view.
and
i
say
hey,
hey!
what
a
wonderful
kind
of
day,
where
you
can
learn
to
work
and
play,
and
get
along
with
each
other.
in
the
beginning,
the
universe
was
created.
this
had
made
a
lot
of
people
very
angry
and
been
widely
regarded
as
a
bad
move.
picture
a
wave
in
the
ocean.
you
can
see
it,
measure
it,
its
height,
the
way
the
sunlight
refracts
when
it
passes
through,
and
it;s
there,
and
you
can
see
it,
you
know
what
it
is.
it;s
a
wave.
and
then
it
crashes
on
the
shore,
and
it;s
gone.
but
the
water
is
still
there.
the
wave
was
just
a
different
way
for
the
water
to
be
for
a
little
while.
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
day
you
saw
something
in
me,
my
whole
life
changed.
your
silence
furnishes
a
dark
house.
but
even
at
the
risk
of
burning,
the
moth
always
seeks
the
light.
it
was
the
last
that
remained
of
a
past
whose
annihilation
had
not
taken
place
because
it
was
still
in
a
process
of
annihilation,
consuming
itself
from
within,
ending
at
every
moment
but
never
ending
its
ending.
the
gentleman
cannot
be
appreciated
in
small
things
but
is
acceptable
in
great
matters.
a
small
man
is
not
acceptable
in
great
matters
but
can
be
appreciated
in
small
things.
there
was
no
reason
for
me
to
stay
in
the
real
world
any
longer.
in
the
real
world,
it
didn;t
matter
if
i
was
there
or
not.
when
i
realized
that,
i
was
no
longer
afraid
of
losing
my
body.
there;s
a
storm
coming,
mr.
wayne.
you
and
your
friends
better
batten
down
the
hatches,
because
when
it
hits,
you;re
all
gonna
wonder
how
you
ever
thought
you
could
live
so
large
and
leave
so
little
for
the
rest
of
us.
i
breathed
in
my
new
surroundings.
the
air
smelled
different
here,
i
don;t
know
whether
it
was
the
desert
air
or
the
dry
trees
or
just
that
i
was
far
away
from
the
stink
of
the
city,
but
i
liked
it.
my
spirit;s
made
up
of
the
ocean,
and
the
sky,
and
the
sun,
and
the
moon,
and
all
my
eyes
can
see.
i
cannot
go
back
to
your
land
of
gloom,
where
black
jagged
shadows
remind
me
of
the
coming
of
your
doom.
i
want
my
own
land.
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
day
we
met,
what
would
i
do?
perhaps
i
would
smile
with
a
kinder
face.
and
maybe,
when
our
eyes
met,
i
would
laugh
even
more.
then
everything
definitely
would
have
gone
better
from
the
beginning.
but
life
is
a
combination
of
miracles.
if
even
one
of
them
were
different,
then
everything
would
change.
why
is
it,
every
time
something
terrible
happens,
everyone
tells
you
the
worst
thing
that
ever
happened
to
them,
as
though
that
makes
it
easier?
let
me
photograph
you
in
this
light,
in
case
it
is
the
last
time
that
we
might
be
exactly
like
we
were
before
we
realized
we
were
sad
of
getting
old.
so
much
of
this
story
is
about
human
will,
about
what
we
can
do
when
we
come
up
against
forces
bigger
than
any
of
us.
whatever
your
beliefs
or
your
lack
thereof,
we
will
live
only
one
version
of
this
life,
and
where
and
when
that
life
starts
determines
so
much.
there;s
a
sign
on
the
wall
but
she
wants
to
be
sure
;cause
you
know
sometimes
words
have
two
meanings.
in
a
tree
by
the
brook,
there;s
a
songbird
who
sings,
sometimes
all
of
our
thoughts
are
misgiven.
you
gotta
see
it
to
believe
it,
the
sky
never
looked
so
blue
it;s
so
hard
to
leave
it,
but
that;s
what
i
always
do.
so
i
keep
thinking
back
to
a
time
under
the
canyon
moon.
learn
to
light
a
candle
in
the
darkest
moments
of
someone;s
life.
be
the
light
that
helps
others
see;
it
is
what
gives
life
its
deepest
significance.
what
i
think
is
if
you
can;t
figure
out
how
to
have
a
simple
date
with
a
woman
who;s
already
agreed
to
go
out
with
you,
then
maybe
you
don;t
deserve
to
go
out
with
her
in
the
first
place.
how;s
that
for
advice?
you
cannot
fly
with
the
eagles
if
you
continue
to
scratch
with
the
turkeys.
they
say
there
is
a
person
who
will
tell
you
how
to
survive
in
this
land...
oh
wait.
that;s
me.
when
i
was
your
age,
television
was
called
books.
and
this
is
a
special
book.
it
was
the
book
my
father
used
to
read
to
me
when
i
was
sick,
and
i
used
to
read
it
to
your
father.
and
today
i;m
gonna
read
it
to
you.
when
you
go
on
the
run,
the
first
thing
you
do
is
lay
down
tracks
in
the
opposite
direction.
but
that
only
works
if
the
bad
guys
find
the
trail
and
believe
it;s
for
real,
which
means
selling
it.
you
need
to
put
on
a
little
show,
make
them
feel
clever.
when
you
make
somebody
work
to
get
a
piece
of
information,
they;ll
believe
it
that
much
more
because
it;s
hard
to
get.
to
me,
you
are
still
nothing
more
than
a
little
boy
who
is
just
like
a
hundred
thousand
other
little
boys.
and
i
have
no
need
of
you.
and
you,
on
your
part,
have
no
need
of
me.
to
you,
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
fox
like
a
hundred
thousand
other
foxes.
but
if
you
tame
me,
then
we
shall
need
each
other.
to
me,
you
will
be
unique
in
all
the
world.
to
you,
i
shall
be
unique
in
all
the
world...
it;s
important
in
life
to
conclude
things
properly.
only
then
can
you
let
go.
otherwise
you
are
left
with
words
you
should
have
said
but
never
did,
and
your
heart
is
heavy
with
remorse.
the
journey
doesn;t
end
here.
death
is
just
another
path,
one
that
we
all
must
take.
the
grey
rain-curtain
of
this
world
rolls
back,
and
all
turns
to
silver
glass,
and
then
you
see
it.
sometimes
we
get
sad
about
things
and
we
don;t
like
to
tell
other
people
that
we
are
sad
about
them.
we
like
to
keep
it
a
secret.
or
sometimes,
we
are
sad
but
we
really
don;t
know
why
we
are
sad,
so
we
say
we
aren;t
sad
but
we
really
are.
and
so
with
the
sunshine
and
the
great
bursts
of
leaves
growing
on
the
trees,
just
as
things
grow
in
fast
movies,
i
had
that
familiar
conviction
that
life
was
beginning
over
again
with
the
summer.
you
shared
something
horrible
with
me,
gave
me
no
time
to
process
it,
and
while
i
was
taking
it
in
you
not
only
attacked
my
integrity,
you
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
myself.
i
do
not
know
what
i
may
appear
to
the
world,
but
to
myself
i
seem
to
have
been
only
like
a
boy
playing
on
the
seashore,
and
diverting
myself
in
now
and
then
finding
a
smoother
pebble
or
a
prettier
shell
than
ordinary,
whilst
the
great
ocean
of
truth
lay
all
undiscovered
before
me.
everyone
gets
everything
he
wants.
i
wanted
a
mission,
and
for
my
sins,
they
gave
me
one.
brought
it
up
to
me
like
room
service.
it
was
a
real
choice
mission,
and
when
it
was
over,
i
never
wanted
another.
just
let
me
wake
up
in
the
morning
to
the
smell
of
new
mown
hay,
to
laugh
and
cry,
to
live
and
die
in
the
brightness
of
my
day.
i
want
to
hear
the
pealing
bell
of
distant
churches
sing.
but
most
of
all
please
free
me
from
this
aching
metal
ring
and
open
out
this
cage
towards
the
sun.
you
must
have
a
goal
because
it;s
just
as
difficult
to
reach
a
destination
you
don;t
have,
as
it
is
to
come
back
from
a
place
you;ve
never
been.
you
can;t
see
the
changes
we
see,
we
who
have
been
with
him
for
so
long.
do
you
think
any
of
us
want
to
look
into
his
eyes
for
the
next
hundred
years
if
he
loses
you?
my
heart
wants
to
beat
like
the
wings
of
the
birds
that
rise
from
the
lake
to
the
trees.
my
heart
wants
to
sigh
like
a
chime
that
flies
from
a
church
on
a
breeze,
to
laugh
like
a
brook
when
it
trips
and
falls
over
stones
on
its
way,
to
sing
through
the
night
like
a
lark
who
is
learning
to
pray.
i
can
hear
those
echoes
in
the
wind
at
night
calling
me
back
in
time,
back
to
you,
in
a
place
far
away
where
the
water
meets
the
sky.
yes,
it
was
her
he
was
looking
at,
and
there
was
meaning
in
his
look.
his
eyes
burned
into
her
as
though
they
would
search
her
through
and
through,
read
her
very
soul.
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
question.
not
a
poem,
confession
or
whatever
it;s
become.
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
would
listen
with
me
to
the
sound
of
our
heartbeats.
i
have
a
dream,
a
song
to
sing,
to
help
me
cope
with
anything.
if
you
see
the
wonder
of
a
fairy
tale
you
can
take
the
future
even
if
you
fail.
you;ll
never
have
that
kind
of
relationship
in
a
world
where
you;re
afraid
to
take
the
first
step
because
all
you
see
is
every
negative
thing
ten
miles
down
the
road.
although
his
voice
was
also
broken
by
uncertainty
and
his
hands
seemed
to
doubt
the
existence
of
things,
it
was
evident
that
he
came
from
the
world
where
men
could
still
sleep
and
remember.
give
me
a
lifetime
of
promises
and
a
world
of
dreams.
speak
the
language
of
love
like
you
know
what
it
means.
you;re
simply
the
best,
better
than
all
the
rest,
better
than
anyone
i
ever
met.
i
don;t
feel
like
that
now.
i
feel
that
as
long
as
the
shire
lies
behind,
safe
and
comfortable,
i
shall
find
wandering
more
bearable:
i
shall
know
that
somewhere
there
is
a
firm
foothold,
even
if
my
feet
cannot
stand
there
again.
i
have
noticed
even
people
who
claim
everything
is
predestined,
and
that
we
can
do
nothing
to
change
it,
look
before
they
cross
the
road.
the
thing
under
my
bed
waiting
to
grab
my
ankle
isn;t
real.
i
know
that,
and
i
also
know
that
if
i;m
careful
to
keep
my
foot
under
the
covers,
it
will
never
be
able
to
grab
my
ankle.
maybe
our
old
wounds
teach
us
something.
they
remind
us
where
we;ve
been
and
what
we;ve
overcome.
they
teach
us
lessons
about
what
to
avoid
in
the
future.
that;s
what
we
like
to
think.
but
that;s
not
always
the
way
it
is.
sometimes
there
are
things
we
just
have
to
learn
over
again.
it
is
now
time
to
make
it
unclear.
to
write
off
lines
that
don;t
make
sense.
i
love
myself
better
than
you.
i
know
it;s
wrong
so
what
should
i
do?
and
one
more
special
message
to
go,
and
then
i;m
done,
and
i
can
go
home.
i
love
myself
better
than
you.
i
know
it;s
wrong
so
what
should
i
do?
you
know
when
i
was
your
age,
i
went
out
to
fishing
with
all
my
brothers
and
my
father,
and
everybody.
and
i
was
the
only
one
who
caught
a
fish.
the
highlander
seemed
to
float
through
life
very
much
the
same
as
a
cloud
in
an
empty
sky,
touching
nothing,
leaving
no
trace
of
his
passing.
his
ear
heard
more
than
what
was
said
to
him,
and
his
slow
speech
had
overtones
not
of
thought,
but
of
understanding
beyond
thought.
nobody
listens
anymore.
i
can;t
talk
to
the
walls
because
they;re
yelling
at
me,
i
can;t
talk
to
my
wife;
she
listens
to
the
walls.
i
just
want
someone
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say.
and
maybe
if
i
talk
long
enough
it;ll
make
sense.
and
i
want
you
to
teach
me
to
understand
what
i
read.
it;s
not
about
changing
the
world.
it;s
about
doing
our
best
to
leave
the
world
the
way
it
is.
it;s
about
respecting
the
will
of
others,
and
believing
in
your
own.
this
year
our
members
have
put
more
things
on
top
of
other
things
than
ever
before.
but
i
should
warn
you,
this
is
no
time
for
complacency.
no,
there
are
still
many
things,
and
i
cannot
emphasize
this
too
strongly,
not
on
top
of
other
things.
i
myself,
on
my
way
here
this
evening,
saw
a
thing
that
was
not
on
top
of
another
thing
in
any
way.
perhaps
love
is
like
a
resting
place,
a
shelter
from
the
storm.
it
exists
to
give
you
comfort.
it
is
there
to
keep
you
warm.
and
in
those
times
of
trouble
when
you
are
most
alone,
the
memory
of
love
will
bring
you
home.
did
you
know?
there
are
three
kinds
of
aces.
those
who
seek
strength,
those
who
live
for
pride,
and
those
who
can
read
the
tide
of
battle.
if
all
these
dreams
might
find
their
way
into
my
day
to
day
scene
i;d
be
under
the
impression
i
was
somewhere
in
between.
not
so
many
things
we
got
to
do
or
places
we
got
to
be.
after
several
hours,
joe
finally
gave
up
on
logic
and
reason,
and
simply
told
the
cabinet
that
he
could
talk
to
plants
and
that
they
wanted
water.
i;ll
tell
you
a
riddle.
you;re
waiting
for
a
train,
a
train
that
will
take
you
far
away.
you
know
where
you
hope
this
train
will
take
you,
but
you
don;t
know
for
sure.
but
it
doesn;t
matter.
how
can
it
not
matter
to
you
where
that
train
will
take
you?
i
wanted
to
understand
as
much
as
i
could
about
the
procedure
as
possible.
i
think
it;s
important
for
my
job
to
understand
the
inner
workings
of
the
work
that
we
do,
well
not
that
i
do,
but
the
work
that
is
done
by
people
where
i
also
work,
the
work
of
my
colleagues.
but
older
than
me
now,
more
constant,
more
real,
and
the
fur,
and
the
mouth,
and
the
innocence
turned
to
hair
and
contentment
that
hangs
in
abasement
-
a
woman
now
standing
where
once
there
was
only
a
girl.
if
you
want
to
save
yourself
the
ticket
price,
go
into
the
kitchen,
cue
up
a
male
choir
singing
the
music
of
hell,
and
get
a
kid
to
start
banging
pots
and
pans
together.
then
close
your
eyes
and
use
your
imagination.
i;d
pull
your
eyes
out
of
your
head,
and
put
them
in
my
own
skull,
and
look
around,
so
i
could
see
the
street
the
way
i
used
to
when
i
was
your
age.
pause
you
who
read
this,
and
think
for
a
moment
of
the
long
chain
of
iron
or
gold,
of
thorns
or
flowers,
that
would
never
have
bound
you,
but
for
the
formation
of
the
first
link
on
one
memorable
day.
they
often
wish
that
people
would
just
once
and
for
all
work
out
where
the
hell
they
wanted
to
be.
i
suppose
it
is
tempting,
if
the
only
tool
you
have
is
a
hammer,
to
treat
everything
as
if
it
were
a
nail.
all
of
these
moments
just
might
find
their
way
into
my
dreams
tonight.
but
i
know
that
they;ll
be
gone
when
the
morning
light
sings
and
brings
new
things.
and
i
will
keep
you
safe
and
strong
and
shelter
from
the
storm.
no
matter
where
it;s
barren,
a
dream
is
being
born.
i;ll
be
everyone
you
need,
no
matter
if
the
sun
don;t
shine
or
if
the
skies
are
blue.
no
matter
what
the
end
is
my
life
began
with
you.
you
know
a
dream
is
like
a
river
ever
changing
as
it
flows
and
a
dreamer;s
just
a
vessel
that
must
follow
where
it
goes.
trying
to
learn
from
what;s
behind
you
and
never
knowing
what;s
in
store
makes
each
day
a
constant
battle
just
to
stay
between
the
shores.
i
am
going
to
keep
on
defying
you.
i
am
going
to
shame
you
with
my
defiance.
you
remind
me
that
i
am
a
mere
mortal
and
you
are
a
prince
of
faerie.
well,
let
me
remind
you
that
means
you
have
much
to
lose
and
i
have
nothing.
you
may
win
in
the
end,
you
may
ensorcell
me
and
hurt
me
and
humiliate
me,
but
i
will
make
sure
you
lose
everything
i
can
take
from
you
on
the
way
down.
i
promise
you
this
is
the
least
of
what
i
can
do.
the
major
difference
between
a
thing
that
might
go
wrong
and
a
thing
that
cannot
possibly
go
wrong
is
that
when
a
thing
that
cannot
possibly
go
wrong
goes
wrong
it
usually
turns
out
to
be
impossible
to
get
at
or
repair.
he
did
not
know
how
long
it
took,
but
later
he
looked
back
on
this
time
of
crying
in
the
corner
of
the
dark
cave
and
thought
of
it
as
when
he
learned
the
most
important
rule
of
survival,
which
was
that
feeling
sorry
for
yourself
didn;t
work.
it
wasn;t
just
that
it
was
wrong
to
do,
or
that
it
was
considered
incorrect.
it
was
more
than
that
-
it
didn;t
work.
there
are
many
people
who
reach
their
conclusions
about
life
like
schoolboys;
they
cheat
their
master
by
copying
the
answer
out
of
a
book
without
having
worked
out
the
sum
for
themselves.
when
the
light
is
running
low,
and
the
shadows
start
to
grow,
and
the
places
that
you
know
seem
like
fantasy,
there;s
a
light
inside
your
soul
that;s
still
shining
in
the
cold
with
the
truth
-
the
promise
in
our
hearts.
don;t
forget.
i;m
with
you
in
the
dark.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
thrill
that
can
go
through
the
human
heart
like
that
felt
by
the
inventor
as
he
sees
some
creation
of
the
brain
unfolding
to
success.
such
emotions
make
a
man
forget
food,
sleep,
friends,
love,
everything.
i
still
think
about
the
letter
you
asked
me
to
write.
it
nags
at
me,
even
though
you;re
gone
and
there;s
no
one
to
give
it
to
anymore.
sometimes
i
work
on
it
in
my
head,
trying
to
map
out
the
story
you
asked
me
to
tell,
about
everything
that
happened
this
past
fall
and
winter.
it;s
all
still
there,
like
a
movie
i
can
watch
when
i
want
to.
which
is
never.
i
came
back
home
from
work
tonight
and
saw
you
there,
with
a
train
set
in
your
hands
and
paint
in
your
hair.
and
i
just
saw
you
this
morning
but
i
don;t
care;
i;m
saying
let;s
never
be
apart
again.
when
you
think
about
it,
we;re
all
different
people
all
through
our
lives.
and
that;s
okay,
that;s
good,
you;ve
got
to
keep
moving,
so
long
as
you
remember
all
the
people
that
you
used
to
be.
i
will
not
forget
one
line
of
this.
not
one
day,
i
swear.
i
will
always
remember
when
the
doctor
was
me.
anywhere
can
be
paradise,
as
long
as
you
have
the
will
to
live.
after
all,
you
are
alive,
so
you
will
always
have
the
chance
to
be
happy.
we
got
questions
we
should
not
ask,
but
how
would
you
feel
if
i
told
you
i
loved
you?
it;s
just
something
that
i
want
to
do.
if
i
were
a
rich
man,
i;d
build
a
big
tall
house
with
rooms
by
the
dozen
right
in
the
middle
of
the
town.
a
fine
tin
roof
with
real
wooden
floors
below.
there
would
be
one
long
staircase
just
going
up
and
one
even
longer
coming
down
and
one
more
leading
nowhere,
just
for
show.
i
etched
your
name
in
the
clouds
but
it
was
lost
when
the
thunder
cried.
i
etched
your
name
in
the
surf
but
it
was
stolen
by
the
rising
tide.
i
etched
your
name
in
my
heart
and
there
it
will
forever
reside.
the
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
sword.
if
you
would
take
a
man;s
life,
you
owe
it
to
him
to
look
into
his
eyes
and
hear
his
final
words.
and
if
you
cannot
bear
to
do
that,
then
perhaps
the
man
does
not
deserve
to
die.
i
wrote
about
how
last
weekend
my
parents
and
i
waited
in
line
at
the
movies
for
an
hour,
and
when
we
finally
got
up
to
the
ticket
booth
lady,
they
were
sold
out!
isn;t
that
sad?
nice
things
don;t
happen
in
storybooks.
or
when
they
do
happen,
something
bad
happens
next.
because
otherwise
the
story
would
be
boring,
and
no
one
would
read
it.
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
alone,
nowhere
to
go
and
no
place
to
call
home.
my
only
friend
was
the
man
in
the
moon
and
even
sometimes
he
would
go
away,
too.
then
one
night,
as
i
closed
my
eyes,
i
saw
a
shadow
flying
high.
he
came
to
me
with
the
sweetest
smile,
told
me
he
wanted
to
talk
for
a
while.
you
can;t
get
back
what
you;ve
lost,
what;s
important
now
is
what
is
it
that
you
still
have.
some
say
the
world
will
end
in
fire,
some
say
in
ice.
from
what
i;ve
tasted
of
desire,
i
hold
with
those
who
favor
fire.
but
if
it
had
to
perish
twice,
i
think
i
know
enough
of
hate,
to
say
that
for
destruction
ice
is
also
great,
and
would
suffice.
now
i
want
you
to
think
and
stop
being
a
smart
aleck.
a
man;s
attitude
goes
some
ways
-
the
way
his
life
will
be.
is
that
something
you
agree
with?
so
since
you
agree,
you
must
be
someone
who
does
not
care
about
the
good
life.
i
don;t
know
if
i
will
have
the
time
to
write
any
more
letters
because
i
might
be
too
busy
trying
to
participate.
so
if
this
does
end
up
being
the
last
letter,
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
i
was
in
a
bad
place
before
i
started
high
school,
and
you
helped
me.
even
if
you
didn;t
know
what
i
was
talking
about
or
know
someone
who;s
gone
through
it,
you
made
me
not
feel
alone.
and
one
day
i
knew
i
had
to
come
back
here.
i
had
to
come
back
and
get
on
the
merry-go-round,
and
eat
cotton
candy,
and
listen
to
a
band
concert.
just
stop
and
breathe,
and
close
my
eyes
and
smell
and
listen.
someone
once
told
me
that
time
was
a
predator
that
stalked
us
all
our
lives.
i
rather
believe
that
time
is
a
companion
who
goes
with
us
on
the
journey
and
reminds
us
to
cherish
every
moment,
because
it
will
never
come
again.
what
we
leave
behind
is
not
as
important
as
how
we;ve
lived.
after
all
number
one,
we;re
only
mortal.
but
the
law
of
loving
others
could
not
be
discovered
by
reason,
because
it
is
unreasonable.
for
string
theory
to
make
sense,
the
universe
should
have
nine
space
dimensions
and
one
time
dimension,
for
a
total
of
ten
dimensions.
i
don;t
like
work
-
no
man
does
-
but
i
like
what
is
in
the
work
-
the
chance
to
find
yourself.
your
own
reality
-
for
yourself,
not
for
others
-
what
no
other
man
can
ever
know.
they
can
only
see
the
mere
show,
and
never
can
tell
what
it
really
means.
but
on
this
particular
day
i
did
not
like
the
color
of
the
sky.
i;m
in
love
with
you,
and
i
know
that
love
is
just
a
shout
into
the
void,
and
that
oblivion
is
inevitable,
and
that
we;re
all
doomed
and
that
there
will
come
a
day
when
all
our
labor
has
been
returned
to
dust,
and
i
know
the
sun
will
swallow
the
only
earth
we;ll
ever
have,
and
i
am
in
love
with
you.

performs
its
grammatical
function,

in
the

how

but
the
house
gets
so
quiet
sitting
here

for
just
an
hour

two
alone
with
you.

who;s

we
passionately
long
that
there
may
be
another
life
in
which
we
shall
be
similar
to
what
we
are
here
below.
but
we
do
not
pause
to
reflect
that,
even
without
waiting
for
that
other
life,
in
this
life,
after
a
few
years
we
are
unfaithful
to
what
we
have
been,
to
what
we
wished
to

he
then
told

many
remarkable

sometimes
half
as

speaking
to
himself,

looking
at

suddenly
with
a
bright
blue
eye
under
his
deep
brows.
often
his
voice
would
turn
to
song,
and
he
would
get
out
of
his

dance
about.
he
told
them
tales
of
bees

the

of

the
strange

of

about
the

almost
a
month,

he
could
see
that
it

exactly
the
kind
of
job
that
would
make
him
happy.
the
merchant
spent
the
entire
day
mumbling
behind
the
counter,
telling
the
boy
to
be
careful
with
the
pieces
and
not
to
break

away.

there

untruth,
and
if
you
clung
to
the
truth

against

you
were

there
was
immediately
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
man
entered.
he
had
never
seen
the
man
in
this
house
before.
he
was
slim
but
firmly
built,
his
clothes
were
black
and
closefitting,
with
many
folds
and
pockets,
buckles
and
buttons
and
a
belt,
all
of
which
gave
the
impression
of
being
very
practical
but
without
making
it
very
clear
what
they
were
actually
for.

saw
the
light
fade
from
the

the
wind
i
heard

the
creatures
outside
looked
from

to

from

it

you
once
again,

said
the
words,

merely
speaking
you
could
create

in

early

to

there;s

you
make

all

it;s
not
enough.

this
stuff,

made

it;s
not
enough.
i;d
like
to

therefore,

it
was
the
most
horrible,
the
most
repellent
thing
she
had
ever
seen,
far
more
nauseating
than
anything
she

imagined
with

that

i
was
never

you
connected
dots
that
weren;t
there,
you
gave
attention
to
the
thoughts
i;d
never
wear;
it;s
not
my
style.
even
though
it;s
so
clear
to
me,
you
shouldn;t
base
the
future
on
the
past,
i
know
you
really
want
this

to

words
bend
our
thinking
to
infinite
paths
of
self-delusion,
and
the
fact
that
we
spend
most
of
our
mental
lives
in
brain
mansions
built
of
words
means
that
we
lack
the
objectivity
necessary
to
see
the
terrible
distortion
of
reality
which
language
brings.
i;ll
light
the
fire,
you
place
the
flowers
in
the
vase
that
you
bought
today.

at
the
fire
for
hours
and
hours
while
i
listen
to

your
love
songs
all

long
for
me,
only
for
me.
tonight
i;m
making
deals
with

and
i
know
it;s
gonna
get
me
in

just
as
long
as
you
know
you
got
me.
to
graduate
you
need
my
course,
dear
boy.
so
it
seems
i
have
something
to
say
about
what
you
do
and
where
you
go.
so
from
now
on
you
and
mitch
are
going
to
spend
every
waking
moment
in
the
lab.
you
will
solve
my
power
problem,
and
you
will
solve
it
by
my
deadline.
well,
this
is
the
end
of
a
perfect
day,
near
the
end
of
a
journey,
too.
but
it
leaves
a
thought
that
is
big
and
strong,
with
a
wish
that
is
kind
and
true.
for
memory
has
painted
this
perfect
day
with
colors
that
never
fade,
and
we
find
at
the
end
of
a
perfect
day
the
soul
of
a
friend
we;ve
made.
before
i
was
famous
i
had
a
whole
bunch
of
jobs
where
all
i
needed
was
boots.
people
would
look
right
past
me,
or
if
they
did
look
at
me,
it
was
with
a
mean
look.
but
when
i
got
famous,
people
would
look
at
me
and
smile
and
wonder
where
they
knew
me
from.
if
they
flat-out
recognized
me,
they;d
laugh
and
dance
like
they;d
won
a
prize,
and
i;d
just
stand
there
and
smile
and
feel
warmth
from
their
love.
so
the
fame
made
the
world,
which
is
a
real
cold
place,
a
little
less
cold.
that;ll
be
a
dispute
to
the
end
of
time,
mr.
brown:
whether
it;s
better
to
do
the
right
thing
for
the
wrong
reason
or
the
wrong
thing
for
the
right
reason.
you
all
have
your
own
distinct
personal
backgrounds.
of
course
some
of
you
come
from
rich
families,
some
from
poor
families.
but
circumstances
beyond
your
control
like
that
shouldn;t
determine
who
you
are.
you
must
all
realize
what
you;re
worth
on
your
own.
the
new-born
child
does
not
realize
that
his
body
is
more
a
part
of
himself
than
surrounding
objects,
and
will
play
with
his
toes
without
any
feeling
that
they
belong
to
him
more
than
the
rattle
by
his
side;
and
it
is
only
by
degrees,
through
pain,
that
he
understands
the
fact
of
the
body.
come
let
me
love
you,
let
me
give
my
life
to
you,
let
me
drown
in
your
laughter,
let
me
die
in
your
arms,
let
me
lay
down
beside
you,
let
me
always
be
with
you.
let
me
finish.
i
thought
i
wanted
to
be
alone
tonight,
and
then
i
realized
that
i
didn;t
because
i
wanted
to
be
with
my
family.
if
you
can;t
keep
it
together
tonight
of
all
nights,
then
as
far
as
i;m
concerned
you
can
all
rot
in
hell.
and
for
the
first
time
there;s
no
pain
in
my
life.
it;s
been
a
long
hard
road
that
i;ve
gone.
we
had
a
good
thing
and
it
made
me
a
man.
and
i
know
you
got
me
going.
pardon
me,
my
feelings
are
showing.
i;m
only
saying
what;s
on
my
mind.
joe,
darling,
you;re
coming
back.
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
i
know?
two
days
ago
you
came
to
this
city
and
you
didn;t
know
anyone.
you
didn;t
know
me
and
i
didn;t
know
you,
and
now
we;re
married.
and
we
both
know
that
that
was
meant
to
be.
so
don;t
you
see?
whoever
makes
the
arrangements
for
people
is
doing
pretty
well
for
us.
that;s
all
we
need
to
know.
benjamin
was
the
oldest
animal
on
the
farm,
and
the
worst
tempered.
he
seldom
talked,
and
when
he
did,
it
was
usually
to
make
some
cynical
remark
-
for
instance,
he
would
say
that
god
had
given
him
a
tail
to
keep
the
flies
off,
but
that
he
would
sooner
have
had
no
tail
and
no
flies.
all
around
us
there
are
powers.
there
are
animals
like
the
whale,
the
bear,
the
wolf,
and
the
eagle.
there
are
powers
like
the
sun
and
moon
and
seasons.
and
there
are
the
powers
inside
of
us
like
happiness
and
anger.
we
can
feel
all
of
these
and
dance
to
them.
they
all
have
much
to
teach
us.
today,
we
saw
the
whale,
so
tonight
we;ll
dance
the
whale
dance.
each
of
us
will
tell
what
we
learned
from
watching
the
whale.
saying
"i
love
you"
is
not
the
words
i
want
to
hear
from
you.
it;s
not
that
i
want
you
not
to
say,
but
if
you
only
knew
how
easy
it
would
be
to
show
me
how
you
feel.
more
than
words
is
all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
real.
then
you
wouldn;t
have
to
say
that
you
love
me.
there
are
places
i;ll
remember
all
my
life,
though
some
have
changed.
some
forever,
not
for
better.
some
have
gone
and
some
remain.
all
these
places
have
their
moments
with
lovers
and
friends
i
still
can
recall.
the
past
is
always
with
us.
where
we
come
from,
what
we
go
through,
how
we
go
through
it;
all
this
matters.
like
at
the
end
of
the
book,
ya
know,
boats
and
tides
and
all.
it;s
like
you
can
change
up,
right,
you
can
say
you;re
somebody
new,
you
can
give
yourself
a
whole
new
story.
i
am
doing
good
to
the
poor,
but
i
differ
in
opinion
about
the
means.
i
think
the
best
way
of
doing
good
to
the
poor
is
not
making
them
easy
in
poverty,
but
leading
them
or
driving
them
out
of
it.
at
last,
we
finally
meet.
i
have
something
for
you,
chancellor;
a
farewell
gift.
for
all
the
things
you;ve
done,
for
the
things
you
might
have
done,
and
for
the
only
thing
you
have
left.
it;s
a
thousand
pages,
give
or
take
a
few.
i;ll
be
writing
more
in
a
week
or
two.
i
could
make
it
longer
if
you
like
the
style.
i
can
change
it
round,
and
i
want
to
be
a
paperback
writer.
i
feel
that
life
is
divided
into
the
horrible
and
the
miserable.
that;s
the
two
categories.
the
horrible
are
like,
i
don;t
know,
terminal
cases,
you
know,
and
blind
people,
crippled.
i
don;t
know
how
they
get
through
life.
it;s
amazing
to
me.
and
the
miserable
is
everyone
else.
so
you
should
be
thankful
that
you;re
miserable,
because
that;s
very
lucky,
to
be
miserable.
the
voice
of
anatomy,
like
the
voice
of
all
nature,
never
reaches
the
mental
ear
of
the
great
commoner.
it
is
the
novel
province
of
anatomy
to
tell
the
truth,
the
whole
truth,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
about
the
structure,
the
origin
and
the
history
of
man.
if
at
some
point
in
life,
you
made
a
mistake
or
keep
failing
over
and
over
again,
and
you
can;t
help
but
think
it;s
useless
and
you;re
a
good
for
nothing;
remember,
you;re
only
taking
a
detour.
and
i;m
sure
further
along
your
path
will
come
a
day
where
you
think,
"it
was
a
good
life
experience."
that;s
why
it;ll
be
fine.
it
doesn;t
matter
what
i
say,
so
long
as
i
sing
with
inflection
that
makes
you
feel
i;ll
convey
some
inner
truth
or
vast
reflection.
but
i;ve
said
nothing
so
far,
and
i
can
keep
it
up
for
as
long
as
it
takes.
i
have
moments
like
that
a
lot,
when
my
brain
falls
asleep
or
something,
and
the
next
thing
i
know
i;ve
missed
something,
as
if
a
puzzle
piece
fell
out
of
the
universe
and
left
me
staring
at
the
blank
place
behind
it.
i;ve
tried
to
hide
it
so
that
no
one
knows,
but
i
guess
it
shows.
when
you
look
into
my
eyes,
what
you
did
and
where
you
are
coming
from,
i
don;t
care
as
long
as
you
love
me.
life
is
a
storm,
my
young
friend.
you
will
bask
in
the
sunlight
one
moment,
be
shattered
on
the
rocks
the
next.
what
makes
you
a
man
is
what
you
do
when
that
storm
comes.
you
must
look
into
that
storm
and
shout
as
you
did
in
rome.
do
your
worst,
for
i
will
do
mine!
then
the
fates
will
know
you
as
we
know
you.
the
more
adams
thought
about
the
future
of
his
country,
the
more
convinced
he
became
that
it
rested
on
education.
before
any
great
things
are
accomplished,
he
wrote
to
a
correspondent,
a
memorable
change
must
be
made
in
the
system
of
education
and
knowledge
must
become
so
general
as
to
raise
the
lower
ranks
of
society
nearer
to
the
higher.
the
education
of
a
nation
instead
of
being
confined
to
a
few
schools
and
universities
for
the
instruction
of
the
few,
must
become
the
national
care
and
expense
for
the
formation
of
the
many.
don;t
tell
me
what;s
in,
don;t
tell
me
how
to
write,
don;t
tell
me
how
to
win
this
fight.
it
isn;t
your
right,
isn;t
your
life,
it
isn;t
your
right
to
take
the
only
thing
that;s
mine.
why
is
it
that
when
one
man
builds
a
wall,
the
next
man
immediately
needs
to
know
what;s
on
the
other
side?
they
can
only
see
the
mere
show,
and
never
can
tell
what
it
really
means.
in
general,
people
only
ask
for
advice
that
they
may
not
follow
it;
or,
if
they
should
follow
it,
that
they
may
have
somebody
to
blame
for
having
given
it.
people
aren;t
all
perfect.
they;re
weak,
ugly,
and
they
get
jealous
and
try
to
bring
others
down.
oddly
enough,
the
better
you
are,
the
harder
it
is
to
live.
that;s
why
i;m
going
to
change
this
world
and
the
people
in
it...
i
only
lose
my
fear
when
i
run.
i
won;t
lose
a
tear
when
i
run.
i
won;t
find
a
heart
so
i
run.
and
now
the
time
is
right
so
we
run.
i
walk
a
mile
with
a
smile
and
i
don;t
know,
i
don;t
care
where
i
am,
but
i
know
it;s
alright.
jump
the
tracks,
can;t
get
back.
i
don;t
know
anyone
around
here,
but
i;m
safe
this
time,
;cause
when
you
tell
me
stupid
things,
like
you
do,
i
have
to
change
the
rules.
and
i
know
that
you
got
everything,
but
i
got
nothing
here
without
you.
you
can
have
my
isolation,
you
can
have
the
hate
that
it
brings,
you
can
have
my
absence
of
faith,
you
can
have
my
everything.
people
come,
people
go
-
they;ll
drift
in
and
out
of
your
life,
almost
like
characters
in
a
favorite
book.
when
you
finally
close
the
cover,
the
characters
have
told
their
story
and
you
start
up
again
with
another
book,
complete
with
new
characters
and
adventures.
then
you
find
yourself
focusing
on
the
new
ones,
not
the
ones
from
the
past.
i
just
hope
you;re
lying
next
to
somebody
who
knows
how
to
love
you
like
me.
there
must
be
a
good
reason
that
you;re
gone.
every
now
and
then
i
think
you
might
want
me
to
come
show
up
at
your
door,
but
i;m
just
too
afraid
that
i;ll
be
wrong.
one
day
she
left
without
a
word,
she
took
away
the
sun.
and
in
the
dark
she
left
behind,
i
knew
what
she
had
done.
she;d
left
me
for
another,
it;s
a
common
tale
but
true.
for
the
days
of
my
life
have
vanished
like
smoke,
and
my
bones
are
parched
like
ash,
and
let
all
my
impurities
be
as
fuel
for
that
fire
until
nothing
remains
but
the
light
alone.
you
boys
are
in
so
much
trouble.
i
can;t
leave
you
alone
for
one
second.
i
guess
next
time
i
go
out,
i;ll
have
to
chain
you
to
the
floor
and
tie
you
to
the
oven.
you
don;t
even
pretend
to
listen.
you
might
as
well
cut
off
your
ears
and
throw
them
in
the
trash
for
as
long
as
you
use
them.
you
are
grounded
for
the
next
month!
your
face
has
fallen
sad
now,
for
you
know
the
time
is
nigh.
but
when
i
must
remove
your
wings
and
you,
you
must
try
to
fly.
come
sail
your
ships
around
me
and
burn
your
bridges
down.
we
make
a
little
history,
baby,
every
time
you
come
around.
i
took
a
walk
alone
last
night,
i
looked
up
at
the
stars
to
try
and
find
an
answer
in
my
life.
i
chose
a
star
for
me,
i
chose
a
star
for
him,
i
chose
two
stars
for
my
kids
and
one
star
for
my
wife.
once
you
free
your
mind
about
a
concept
of
harmony
and
music
being
correct
you
can
do
whatever
you
want.
so,
nobody
told
me
what
to
do,
and
there
was
no
preconception
of
what
to
do.
what
have
i
got
to
do
to
make
you
love
me?
what
have
i
got
to
do
to
make
you
care?
what
do
i
do
when
lightning
strikes
me
and
i
wake
to
find
that
you;re
not
there?
i
must
not
fear.
fear
is
the
mind
killer.
fear
is
the
little
death
that
brings
total
obliteration.
i
will
face
my
fear.
i
will
permit
it
to
pass
over
me
and
through
me.
and
when
my
fear
is
gone
i
will
turn
and
face
fear;s
path,
and
only
i
will
remain.
wealth
can
be
very
empty
when
you
don;t
have
someone
to
share
it
with.
but
by
the
time
i
realized
that,
no
one
would
have
me
except
men
who
wanted
my
money
more
than
i
did.
got
me
thinking.
i
know
what
i
love
too.
family
and
friends.
all
the
ones
here
and
all
ones
gone.
i
love
my
dog,
and
this
orchard,
and
a
crumbledown
house.
under
the
lights
when
everything
goes.
nowhere
to
hide
when
i;m
getting
you
close
when
we
move,
well,
you
already
know.
if
you;ve
had
half
as
much
fun
watching
the
show
as
we;ve
had
doing
it,
well
then
we;ve
had
twice
as
much
fun
doing
the
show
as
you;ve
had
watching
it.
i
want
adventure
in
the
great
wide
somewhere.
i
want
it
more
than
i
can
tell.
and
for
once
it
might
be
grand
to
have
someone
understand;
i
want
so
much
more
than
they;ve
got
planned.
if
you;re
looking
for
the
word
that
means
caring
about
someone
beyond
all
rationality
and
wanting
them
to
have
everything
they
want
no
matter
how
much
it
destroys
you,
it;s
love.
and
when
you
love
someone
you
don;t
stop,
ever.
even
when
people
roll
their
eyes,
and
call
you
crazy.
even
then.
especially
then.
so
if
this
was
a
touching
romantic
story
this
is
probably
where
a
new
feeling
would
wash
over
me
and
suddenly
we
would
be
furiously
making
out
with
the
fire
of
a
thousand
suns.
but
this
isn;t
a
touching
romantic
story.
focus
your
attention
on
the
now
and
tell
me
what
problem
you
have
at
this
moment.
i
am
not
getting
any
answer
because
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
problem
when
your
attention
is
fully
in
the
now.
a
situation
that
needs
to
be
either
dealt
with
or
accepted
-
yes.
take
one
moment
to
escape,
it
will
change
your
mood
when
you;re
walking
on
the
moon.
chase
your
happy
place,
it
will
change
your
groove
when
you;re
dancing
on
the
moon.
when
we
dance
again,
all
our
trouble
seems
to
fade
away.
this
is
how
i
feel
when
you
take
me
to
some
levels
that
i;ve
never
been.
you
don;t
need
money,
don;t
take
fame.
don;t
need
no
credit
card
to
ride
this
train.
it;s
strong
and
it;s
sudden
and
it;s
cruel
sometimes,
but
it
might
just
save
your
life.
that;s
the
power
of
love.
he;s
got
to
make
his
own
mistakes
and
learn
to
mend
the
mess
he
makes.
he;s
old
enough
to
know
what;s
right
but
young
enough
not
to
choose
it.
he;s
noble
enough
to
win
the
world
but
weak
enough
to
lose
it.
he;s
a
new
world
man...
blackbird
singing
in
the
dead
of
night,
take
these
broken
wings
and
learn
to
fly.
all
your
life
you
were
only
waiting
for
this
moment
to
arise.
i
remember
way
back
then
when
everything
was
true
and
when
we
would
have
such
a
very
good
time.
such
a
fine
time,
such
a
happy
time.
it;s
a
fallen
situation
when
all
eyes
are
turned
in
and
a
love
isn;t
flowing
the
way
it
could
have
been.
you
brought
it
all
on
but
it
feels
so
wrong.
you
brought
it
all
on.
i
don;t
believe
this
song.
language
does
for
intelligence
what
the
wheel
does
for
the
feet
and
the
body.
it
enables
them
to
move
from
thing
to
thing
with
greater
ease
and
speed
and
ever
less
involvement.
a
year
has
passed
since
i
wrote
my
note
but
i
should
have
known
this
right
from
the
start:
only
hope
can
keep
me
together;
love
can
mend
your
life
but
love
can
break
your
heart.
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
turn
back
time,
impossible
as
it
may
seem,
but
i
wish
i
could
so
bad.
quit
playing
games
with
my
heart.
i
live
my
life
the
way
to
keep
you
coming
back
to
me.
everything
i
do
is
for
you,
so
what
is
it
that
you
can;t
see?
social
scientists
sometimes
talk
about
the
concept
of
"identity".
it
is
the
idea
that
you
have
a
particular
vision
of
the
kind
of
person
you
are,
and
you
feel
awful
when
you
do
things
that
are
out
of
line
with
that
vision.
nature
never
appeals
to
intelligence
until
habit
and
instinct
are
useless.
there
is
no
intelligence
where
there
is
no
need
of
change.
fortune,
which
has
a
great
deal
of
power
in
other
matters
but
especially
in
war,
can
bring
about
great
changes
in
a
situation
through
very
slight
forces.
fools
rush
in
where
wise
men
never
go,
but
wise
men
never
fall
in
love
so
how
are
they
to
know?
when
we
met
i
felt
my
life
begin.
so
open
up
your
heart
and
let
this
fool
rush
in.
maybe
someday
we
can
talk
about
our
past
and
we
can
talk
about
the
weather;
whenever
you
leave
i
don;t
care
what
i;m
remembered
for,
i
just
want
to
be
remembered.
imagine
you
were
born
without
a
memory.
who
would
you
be?
you
could
be
nothing;
if
you
didn;t
have
memory,
you
wouldn;t
be
able
to
function
in
our
world.
we;ve
just
begun
to
learn
about
the
water
and
its
secrets,
just
as
we;ve
only
touched
on
outer
space.
we
don;t
entirely
rule
out
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
some
form
of
life
on
another
planet,
and
why
not
some
entirely
different
form
of
life
in
a
world
we
already
know
is
inhabited
by
millions
of
living
creatures?
in
a
hamlet
of
ten
households,
there
are
bound
to
be
those
who
are
my
equal
in
doing
their
best
for
others
and
in
being
trustworthy
in
what
they
say,
but
they
are
unlikely
to
be
as
eager
to
learn
as
i
am.
i
know
there;s
something
in
the
wake
of
your
smile.
i
get
a
notion
from
the
look
in
your
eyes.
you;ve
built
a
love
but
that
love
falls
apart.
your
little
piece
of
heaven
turns
too
dark.
where
are
those
happy
days,
they
seem
so
hard
to
find.
i
tried
to
reach
for
you,
but
you
have
closed
your
mind.
whatever
happened
to
our
love?
i
wish
i
understood.
it
used
to
be
so
nice,
it
used
to
be
so
good.
to
put
things
simply,
if
your
past
makes
your
present...
then
your
present
can
and
will
make
your
future.
when
you
think
about
it
that
way...
you
absolutely
have
the
potential
to
be
anything
you
want
to
be.
if
the
world
thinks
you;re
a
monster,
what
does
it
matter?
the
world
is
wrong.
but
when
you
start
to
think
of
yourself
as
a
monster...
even
if
you
lose
a
spell
card
battle,
you
win
if
you
feel
good.
it;s
a
game
after
all.
a
game
isn;t
there
to
entertain
you.
you
enjoy
the
game
yourself.
maybe
when
you
reach
the
point
when
you
can
enjoy
anything,
you
see
the
true
glamour
of
the
spell
card
for
the
first
time.
hey,
baby,
you
know
it;s
funny.
even
though
i
heard
it
so
many
times
in
the
court
case,
i
still
can;t
get
used
to
the
fact
that
your
real
name
is
miles.
it;s
a
cool
name,
though.
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
great
miles
songs.
but
we
still
have
to
get
through
all
those
baby
songs
first.
i
can;t
wait
until
the
day
when
it;s
just
us,
music
and
the
road.
you
wished
for
a
closed
world,
where
you
alone
are
comfortable.
in
order
to
protect
the
weakness
of
your
heart.
in
order
to
protect
the
pleasures
in
your
life.
this
is
merely
the
result.
for
people
cannot
live
in
a
world
that
is
yours
alone.
they
cannot
live
in
a
space
that
is
closed
off.
but
you
wished
for
the
world,
the
world
that
surrounds
you,
to
be
closed
off.
your
heart
and
mind
eliminated
everything
you
didn;t
like
and
wished
for
a
world
as
solitary
as
possible.
and
that
has
led
to
this
little
haven
for
your
soul.
this
is
one
of
the
many
ends
that
could
occur.
this
is
the
end
of
the
world
that
you
have
brought
about.
the
time
has
come
for
man
to
set
himself
a
goal.
the
time
has
come
for
man
to
plant
the
seed
of
his
highest
hope.
his
soil
is
still
rich
enough.
but
one
day
this
soil
will
be
poor
and
domesticated,
and
no
tall
tree
will
be
able
to
grow
in
it.
alas,
the
time
is
coming
when
man
will
no
longer
shoot
the
arrow
of
his
longing
beyond
man,
and
the
string
of
his
bow
will
have
forgotten
how
to
whir.
you;re
missing
the
point.
there;s
no
throne,
there
is
no
version
of
this
where
you
come
out
on
top.
maybe
your
army
comes
and
maybe
it;s
too
much
for
us,
but
it;s
all
on
you.
because
if
we
can;t
protect
the
earth,
you
can
be
damned
well
sure
we;ll
avenge
it.
the
spirit
and
the
senses
so
easily
grow
dead
to
the
impressions
of
the
beautiful
and
the
perfect
that
one
ought
everyday
to
hear
a
little
song,
read
a
good
poem,
see
a
fine
picture
and
if
it
were
possible,
to
speak
a
few
reasonable
words.
give
me
reasons
we
should
be
complete.
you
should
be
with
him,
i
can;t
compete.
you
looked
at
me
like
i
was
someone
else,
oh
well,
can;t
you
see?
i
don;t
wanna
slow
dance
in
the
dark.
love
isn;t
just
wanting
another
person
the
way
you
want
to
own
an
object
you
see
in
a
store.
that;s
just
desire.
you
want
to
have
it
around,
take
it
home
and
set
it
up
somewhere
in
the
apartment
like
a
lamp.
there
is
something
about
yourself
that
you
don;t
know.
something
that
you
will
deny
even
exists,
until
it;s
too
late
to
do
anything
about
it.
it;s
the
only
reason
you
get
up
in
the
morning.
we
share
an
addiction.
we;re
approval
junkies.
we;re
all
in
it
for
the
slap
on
the
back
and
the
gold
watch.
there
comes
a
point
when
you
just
love
someone.
not
because
they;re
good,
or
bad,
or
anything
really.
you
just
love
them.
it
doesn;t
mean
you;ll
be
together
forever.
it
doesn;t
mean
you
won;t
hurt
each
other.
it
just
means
you
love
them.
sometimes
in
spite
of
who
they
are,
and
sometimes
because
of
who
they
are.
and
you
know
that
they
love
you,
sometimes
because
of
who
you
are,
and
sometimes
in
spite
of
it.
you;re
not
a
bad
person.
you
are
a
very
good
person
who
bad
things
have
happened
to,
you
understand.
besides
the
world
isn;t
split
into
good
people
and
death
eaters.
we;ve
all
got
both
light,
and
dark
inside
of
us,
what
matters
is
the
part
we
choose
to
act
on.
that;s
who
we
really
are.
i
wish
that
i
was
born
a
thousand
years
ago.
i
wish
that
i;d
sailed
the
darkened
seas
on
a
great
big
clipper
ship,
going
from
this
land
to
that
in
a
sailor;s
suit
and
cap.
away
from
the
big
city
where
man
cannot
be
free
of
all
the
evils
of
this
town
and
of
himself
and
those
around.
in
most
cases,
there
is
more
to
be
gained
by
maximizing
the
performance
of
the
driver
than
tricking
out
the
car.
the
most
important
factor
is
the
driver,
the
ultimate
control
system
of
a
race
car.
she
can
kill
with
a
smile,
she
can
wound
with
her
eyes,
she
can
ruin
your
faith
with
her
casual
lies,
and
she
only
reveals
what
she
wants
you
to
see.
she
hides
like
a
child,
but
she;s
always
a
woman
to
me.
often,
after
the
first
years
of
marriage,
the
husband
seems
to
lose
interest
in
the
wife.
he
reads
the
paper
at
the
breakfast
table,
he
doesn;t
answer
when
you
talk
to
him.
in
short,
he
doesn;t
even
know
you;re
alive.
you
have
two
choices:
you
can
keep
running
and
hiding
and
blaming
the
world
for
your
problems,
or
you
can
stand
up
for
yourself
and
decide
to
be
somebody
important.
it
is
at
this
point
in
our
story
that
along
comes
a
spider.
for
the
first
time
the
magnitude
of
what
he
had
taken
came
home
to
him.
how
could
you
communicate
with
the
future?
it
was
of
its
nature
impossible.
either
the
future
would
resemble
the
present,
in
which
case
it
would
not
listen
to
him:
or
it
would
be
different
from
it,
and
his
predicament
would
be
meaningless.
it
is
truly
amazing
what
you
can
do
when
you
believe
in
your
own
ability.
that;s
why
you
need
faith
-
a
deep
down,
dogged
belief
that,
regardless
of
the
evidence,
you
are
going
to
make
it!
you
are
going
to
achieve
what
you
have
set
out
to
accomplish.
you
are
going
to
make
a
difference
in
this
life.
who
cares
if
we
don;t
see
the
sun
shine
ever
again?
i
want
you
more
than
any
blue
sky.
the
weather
can
go
crazy.
grief
is
like
a
drunken
house
guest,
always
coming
back
for
one
more
goodbye
hug.
baby,
ever
wondered
why
i
could
make
you
laugh
and
cry?
eclipsing
all
your
summer
skies,
some
things
never
change.
and
i
need
it
more
than
love,
and
i
love
it
more
than
life,
and
i
want
those
stars
above
to
shine
this
night.
i;m
alive
in
a
city
in
a
country
of
the
world.
and
i
want
to
go
on
living,
i
want
to
see
my
life
unfold.
you
know
it;s
hard
to
go
on
looking
at
the
stories
of
our
day
and
the
dangers
we;re
all
facing
growing
worse
in
every
way.
and
you
would
think
with
all
of
the
genius
and
the
brilliance
of
these
times,
we
might
find
a
higher
purpose
and
a
better
use
of
mind.
again,
i
go
back
to
the
working
really
hard
to
get
someone
else
a
piece
thing.
the
payoff
is
never
gonna
be
as
great
for
you
as
it
is
for
them.
don;t
you
think
you;ve
been
using
these
birds
to
avoid
interacting
with
your
own
species
for
long
enough?
i
have
dreamt
in
my
life,
dreams
that
have
stayed
with
me
ever
after,
and
changed
my
ideas;
they
have
gone
through
and
through
me,
like
wine
through
water,
and
altered
the
color
of
my
mind.
and
this
is
one:
i;m
going
to
tell
it
-
but
take
care
not
to
smile
at
any
part
of
it.
by
love
you
mean
big
lightning
bolts
to
the
heart,
where
you
can;t
eat
and
you
can;t
work,
and
you
just
run
off
and
get
married
and
make
babies.
the
reason
you
haven;t
felt
it
is
because
it
doesn;t
exist.
what
you
call
love
was
invented
by
guys
like
me.
sally
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
say.
should
we
tell
her
the
things
that
went
on
there
that
day?
should
we
tell
her
about
it?
now,
what
should
we
do?
well,
what
would
you
do
if
your
mother
asked
you?
there
before
me
was
a
woman
who
had
finally,
after
all
this
time,
made
it
to
the
start
line,
at
the
absolute
worst
moment
imaginable.
it
was
truly
a
tragic
sight
of
a
truly
hopeless
girl
who
had
just
begun
her
first
love
when
it
was
far
too
late.
as
you
decide,
you
shall
be
left
as
you
were
before,
and
neither
richer
nor
wiser,
unless
the
sense
of
service
rendered
to
a
man
in
mortal
distress
may
be
counted
as
a
kind
of
riches
of
the
soul.
i
realized
that
back
then,
the
reason
i
wanted
to
become
human,
was
that
i
really
just
wanted
to
have
friends.
now,
i
just
want
to
be
a
monster
that
can
help
luffy.
we
can
now
get
these
kids
to
buy
just
about
anything.
we
can
have
them
chasing
a
new
trend
every
week.
and
that
is
good
for
the
economy.
and
what;s
good
for
the
economy
is
good
for
the
country.
give
me
the
child...
through
dangers
untold
and
hardships
unnumbered,
i
have
fought
my
way
here
to
the
castle
beyond
the
goblin
city
to
take
back
the
child
which
you
have
stolen.
for
my
will
is
as
strong
as
yours
and
my
kingdom
as
great.
you
have
no
power
over
me.
breathe,
breathe
in
the
air.
don;t
be
afraid
to
care.
leave
but
don;t
leave
me.
look
around,
choose
your
own
ground.
for
long
you
live
and
high
you
fly.
and
smiles
you;ll
give
and
tears
you;ll
cry.
and
all
you
touch
and
all
you
see
is
all
your
life
will
ever
be.
you
think
you;re
any
different
from
me,
or
your
friends,
or
this
tree?
if
you
listen
hard
enough,
you
can
hear
every
living
thing
breathing
together.
you
can
feel
everything
growing.
we;re
all
living
together,
even
if
most
folks
don;t
act
like
it.
we
all
have
the
same
roots,
and
we
are
all
branches
of
the
same
tree.
she
left
the
lighthouse
and
went
down
to
the
beach
to
look
at
the
moon
pure
and
straight,
and
she
stood
in
the
shallows
and
let
her
feet
sink
into
the
sand
as
the
patter-waves
tickled
her
ankles.
and
that;s
when
she
saw
it,
a
school
of
tiny
fish,
all
darting
around
like
marbles
in
a
chalk
circle,
and
they
were
lit
up
electric,
mostly
silver
but
some
gold
and
pink
too.
they
came
and
danced
around
her
ankles,
and
she
could
feel
their
little
electric
fish
bodies,
and
it
was
like
she
was
standing
under
the
moon
and
in
the
moon
at
the
same
time.
and
that
was
something
she
hadn;t
seen
before.
i
always
loved
you,
and
if
one
loves
anyone,
one
loves
the
whole
person,
just
as
they
are
and
not
as
one
would
like
them
to
be.
in
your
heart
i
see
the
start
of
every
night
and
every
day.
in
your
eyes
i
get
lost,
i
get
washed
away.
just
as
long
as
i;m
here
in
your
arms
i
could
be
in
no
better
place.
the
only
ones
who
should
kill
are
those
prepared
to
be
killed.
if
one
must
drink,
then
let
one
drink
thrice
a
month,
for
more
is
bad.
if
one
gets
drunk
twice
a
month,
it
is
better;
if
one
gets
drunk
once
a
month,
that
is
better
still;
and
if
one
doesn;t
drink
at
all,
that
is
the
best
of
all.
in
short,
our
gentleman
became
so
caught
up
in
reading
that
he
spent
his
nights
reading
from
dusk
till
dawn
and
his
days
reading
from
sunrise
to
sunset,
and
so
with
too
little
sleep
and
too
much
reading
his
brains
dried
up,
causing
him
to
lose
his
mind.
for
just
one
second,
look
at
your
life
and
see
how
perfect
it
is.
stop
looking
for
the
next
secret
door
that
is
going
to
lead
you
to
your
real
life.
stop
waiting.
this
is
it:
there;s
nothing
else.
it;s
here,
and
you;d
better
decide
to
enjoy
it
or
you;re
going
to
be
miserable
wherever
you
go,
for
the
rest
of
your
life,
forever.
for
someone
who
was
never
meant
for
this
world,
i
must
confess
i;m
suddenly
having
a
hard
time
leaving
it.
for
every
man
there
is
a
cause
which
he
would
gladly
die
for.
defend
the
right
to
have
a
place
to
which
he
can
belong
to.
and
every
man
will
fight
with
his
bare
hands
in
desperation.
and
shed
his
blood
to
stem
the
flood
to
barricade
invasion.
there
are
so
many
different
ways
to
be
connected
to
people.
there
are
the
people
you
feel
this
unspoken
connection
to,
even
though
there;s
not
even
a
word
for
it.
there;s
the
people
who
you;ve
known
forever
who
know
you
in
this
way
that
other
people
can;t
because
they;ve
seen
you
change...
they;ve
let
you
change.
i
am
dracula
and
i
welcome
you
to
my
house.
i
must
apologize
for
not
being
here
to
greet
you
personally,
but
i
trust
you;ve
found
everything
you
needed.
i
will
rain
down
silver
and
gold
for
you.
i
will
shatter
the
black
night,
break
it
open,
and
pour
out
a
million
stars.
turn
away
from
the
darkness,
the
madness,
the
pain.
open
your
eyes
and
know
that
i
am
here.
that
i
remember
and
hope.
open
your
eyes
and
look
at
the
light.
if
we
all
go
for
the
blonde
and
block
each
other,
not
a
single
one
of
us
is
going
to
get
her.
so
then
we
go
for
her
friends,
but
they
will
all
give
us
the
cold
shoulder
because
no
one
likes
to
be
second
choice.
but
what
if
none
of
us
goes
for
the
blonde?
we
won;t
get
in
each
other;s
way
and
we
won;t
insult
the
other
girls.
it;s
the
only
way
to
win.
there
can
be
no
light
without
the
dark,
and
so
it
is
with
magic.
myself,
i
always
strive
to
live
within
the
light.
is
that
what
you
told
tom
riddle,
sir,
when
he
came
asking
questions?
that
is
right,
but
i
held
something
back.
i
see
some
real
genius
in
your
flying,
maverick,
but
i
can;t
say
that
in
there.
i
was
afraid
that
everyone
in
the
tax
trailer
would
see
right
through
me,
and
i
just
don;t
want
anyone
to
know
that
i;ve
fallen
for
you.
i
know
that
you
wanna
but
you
can;t
;cause
you
gotta
stay
cool
in
the
corner
when
the
truth
is
that
you
wanna
move.
well,
the
real
reason
that
you;ve
been
sent
over
here
is
because
they
wanted
you
to
be
evaluated...
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
are
mentally
ill.
this
is
the
real
reason.
why
do
you
think
they
might
think
that?
a
good
plan
today
is
better
than
a
perfect
plan
tomorrow.
you
spend
your
life
in
a
dream
that
you
can;t
escape,
;cause
you
live
your
life
in
a
coma,
you;re
never
awake.
if
you;d
open
your
eyes
then
maybe
you;d
see
what;s
at
stake.
you;re
sleeping.
you;re
sleeping.
this
is
a
life-or-death
elimination
match.
the
only
way
to
survive...
is
to
win.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
those
are
the
rules
of
the
game.
which
is
why
i
am
bowing
out
of
the
game.
for
children
love
is
a
feeling;
for
adults,
it
is
a
decision.
children
wait
to
learn
if
their
love
is
true
by
seeing
how
long
it
lasts;
adults
make
their
love
true
by
never
wavering
from
their
commitment.
our
emotions
cloud
our
perceptions.
it;s
no
wonder
this
library
is
the
most
wonderful
place
on
earth
to
you,
but
other
people
don;t
see
it
that
way.
never
give
up
on
everything
if
one
thing
is
too
hard.
never
give
up
when
it
falls
down;
just
go
back
to
the
start.
never
give
up
on
everything;
never
give
up
when
you
can
still
believe.
time
after
time
we
miss
the
chances
for
us
to
find
a
better
life.
no
looking
back,
no
pulling
punches
-
this
is
the
fact
time
after
time.
i
needed
all
the
feelings
to
stop
boiling
like
a
pot
of
dal
and
be
cool
enough
for
me
to
taste
them.
although
some
men
who
were
easy
with
their
words
said
that
it
was
worth
sacrificing
one;s
life
for
a
night
of
love
with
such
an
arousing
woman,
the
truth
was
that
no
one
made
any
effort
to
do
so.
he
always
seemed
to
women
different
from
what
he
was,
and
they
loved
in
him
not
himself,
but
the
man
created
by
their
imagination,
whom
they
had
been
eagerly
seeking
all
their
lives;
and
afterwards,
when
they
noticed
their
mistake,
they
loved
him
all
the
same.
it
so
happened
that
during
those
days,
among
so
many
other
carnival
attractions,
there
arrived
in
the
town
the
traveling
show
of
the
woman
who
had
been
changed
into
a
spider
for
having
disobeyed
her
parents.
the
admission
to
see
her
was
not
only
less
than
the
admission
to
see
the
angel,
but
people
were
permitted
to
ask
her
all
manner
of
questions
about
her
absurd
state
and
to
examine
her
up
and
down
so
that
no
one
would
ever
doubt
the
truth
of
her
horror.
in
the
short
term,
it
would
make
me
happy
to
go
play
outside.
in
the
long
term,
it
would
make
me
happier
to
do
well
at
school
and
become
successful.
but
in
the
very
long
term,
i
know
which
will
make
better
memories.
when
we
conceive
of
the
sweetest
being
ever,
we
are
conceiving
of
the
being
that
exists
both
in
the
mind
and
in
reality.
since
the
ninja
is
that
being
than
which
nothing
sweeter
can
be
conceived
and
that
being
exists
in
the
mind
and
in
reality,
the
ninja
exists
in
reality.
but
i
believe
in
true
love,
you
know?
i
don;t
believe
that
everybody
gets
to
keep
their
eyes
or
not
get
sick
or
whatever,
but
everybody
should
have
true
love,
and
it
should
last
at
least
as
long
as
your
life
does.
everybody
knows
in
their
bones
that
something
is
eternal,
and
that
something
has
to
do
with
human
beings.
man,
don;t
tell
me
how
good
i
was.
i
just
got
away
with
it
because
i
had
a
hangover.
i
was
too
mad
to
be
scared
and
too
sick
to
worry
about
it.
you
know
that.
esteban
stood
at
the
front
of
the
room,
staring
at
the
page.
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
us.
we
cheered
again,
even
louder
this
time.
i
don;t
know
if
any
of
us
really
understood
his
dad;s
poem.
but
for
a
long
time
after
he;d
finished
reading,
i
thought
about
that
army
of
ants,
how
they
were
coming
together.
like
us.
time
grabs
you
by
the
wrist,
directs
you
where
to
go.
so
make
the
best
of
this
test,
and
don;t
ask
why;
it;s
not
a
question,
but
a
lesson
learned
in
time.
it;s
something
unpredictable,
but
in
the
end
it;s
right.
i
hope
you
had
the
time
of
your
life.
you
do
not
have
to
sit
outside
in
the
dark.
if,
however,
you
want
to
look
at
the
stars,
you
will
find
that
darkness
is
necessary.
but
the
stars
neither
require
nor
demand
it.
i;m
just
not
the
guy
for
you.
i
mean,
you
need
a
guy
who;s
happy
and
perky
all
the
time.
maybe
a
guy
who;s
had
part
of
his
brain
removed
and
he
thinks
he;s
a
bunny
and
you
can
go
off
and
be
bunnies
together.
learn
to
see
me
as
a
brother
instead
of
two
distant
strangers
and
that;s
how
it;s
supposed
to
be.
how
can
the
devil
take
a
brother
if
he;s
close
to
me?
i;d
love
to
go
back
to
when
we
played
as
kids.
but
things
change...
that;s
the
way
it
is.
like
the
generations
of
leaves,
the
lives
of
mortal
men.
now
the
wind
scatters
the
old
leaves
across
the
earth,
now
the
living
timber
bursts
with
the
new
buds
and
spring
comes
;round
again.
and
so
with
men:
as
one
generation
comes
to
life,
another
dies
away.
in
any
new
job
there;s
always
friction
with
your
coworkers.
they;re
wondering
if
the
boss
likes
the
new
guy
better,
if
he;s
going
to
make
them
look
bad.
in
some
jobs,
that
can
get
you
a
dark
look
in
the
break
room;
in
other
jobs,
that
can
get
you
a
bullet
in
the
back
of
the
head.
the
odds
are
that
you
will
generally
meet
the
worst
of
them.
the
reason
is
that
men
who
have
something
going
for
them
in
their
lives,
men
who
passionately
live
life
with
a
purpose,
are
usually
too
busy
living
their
dreams
to
hang
out
"trolling
for
chicks."
how
sweet
it
is
to
love
someone,
how
right
it
is
to
care.
how
long
it;s
been
since
yesterday,
what
about
tomorrow,
and
what
about
our
dreams
and
all
the
memories
we
share?
i;m
going
to
marry
you
on
a
mountaintop,
and
as
we
reach
the
peak,
that;s
when
the
snow
will
stop.
i;m
going
to
look
at
you
coming
down
that
aisle
that;s
made
of
sticks
and
stones,
and
we;re
both
going
to
smile,
;cause
our
love
has
begun.
the
night;s
always
waiting,
still
and
unseen.
the
harder
you
focus,
the
darker
it
seems.
a
lot
of
people
say
they
want
to
be
great,
but
they;re
not
willing
to
make
the
sacrifices
necessary
to
achieve
greatness.
they
have
other
concerns,
whether
important
or
not,
and
they
spread
themselves
out.
that;s
totally
fine.
after
all,
greatness
is
not
for
everybody.
it;s
a
basic
truth
of
the
human
condition,
that
everybody
lies.
the
only
variable
is
about
what.
the
weird
thing
about
telling
someone
they;re
dying
is
that,
it
tends
to
focus
their
priorities.
find
out
what
matters
to
them.
what
they;re
willing
to
die
for...
what
they;re
willing
to
lie
for.
it;s
the
job
that;s
never
started
as
takes
longest
to
finish,
as
my
old
gaffer
used
to
say.
perhaps
love
is
like
a
window,
perhaps
an
open
door.
it
invites
you
to
come
closer.
it
wants
to
show
you
more.
and
even
if
you
lose
yourself,
and
don;t
know
what
to
do,
the
memory
of
love
will
see
you
through.
owners
of
dogs
will
have
noticed
that,
if
you
provide
them
with
food
and
water
and
shelter
and
affection,
they
will
think
you
are
god.
whereas
owners
of
cats
are
compelled
to
realize
that,
if
you
provide
them
with
food
and
water
and
shelter
and
affection,
they
draw
the
conclusion
that
they
are
gods.
perhaps
the
most
valuable
result
of
all
education
is
the
ability
to
make
yourself
do
the
thing
you
have
to
do,
when
it
ought
to
be
done,
whether
you
like
it
or
not;
it
is
the
first
lesson
that
ought
to
be
learned;
and
however
early
a
man;s
training
begins,
it
is
probably
the
last
lesson
that
he
learns
thoroughly.
but
it
is
important
to
know
this,
to
know
your
roots.
to
know
where
you
started
as
a
person.
if
not,
your
own
life
seems
unreal
to
you.
like
a
puzzle.
like
you
have
missed
the
beginning
of
a
story
and
now
you
are
in
the
middle
of
it,
trying
to
understand.
there;s
a
feeling
i
get
when
i
look
to
the
west
and
my
spirit
is
crying
for
leaving.
in
my
thoughts
i
have
seen
rings
of
smoke
through
the
trees
and
the
voices
of
those
who
stand
looking.
as
my
bones
grew
they
did
hurt.
they
hurt
really
bad.
i
tried
hard
to
have
a
father
but
instead
i
had
a
dad.
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
i
don;t
hate
you
anymore.
there
is
nothing
i
could
say
that
i
haven;t
thought
before.
it;s
so
relieving
to
know
that
you;re
leaving
as
soon
as
you
get
paid.
it;s
so
relaxing
to
hear
you;re
asking
wherever
you
get
your
way.
it;s
so
soothing
to
know
that
you;ll
sue
me,
this
is
starting
to
sound
the
same.
i
miss
the
comfort
in
being
sad.
i
was
born
in
a
town
that
was
straight
out
of
a
fairy
tale.
many
people
died
there,
and
when
i
walked
away,
i
held
hands
with
my
other
self.
to
me
it
seemed
like
we
were
the
only
two
people
in
the
world.
neither
one
of
us
possessed
a
real
name.
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
others
pressing
forward,
and
they
came
forth
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron;
and
they
did
press
forward
through
the
mist
of
darkness,
clinging
to
the
rod
of
iron,
even
until
they
did
come
forth
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree.
here
we
go,
another
night
out.
waited
all
week
just
to
get
out.
where
do
we
come
from?
do
i
know
your
name?
doesn;t
really
matter;
in
this
life
we;re
all
the
same.
move
for
me,
i;ll
move
for
you.
whatever
principle
of
intelligence
we
attain
unto
in
this
life,
it
will
rise
with
us
in
the
resurrection.
and
if
a
person
gains
more
knowledge
and
intelligence
in
this
life
through
his
diligence
and
obedience
than
another,
he
will
have
so
much
the
advantage
in
the
world
to
come.
but
no
matter
how
effective
the
lesson
was,
i
never
really
used
it
after
that.
i
didn;t
enjoy
doing
it
that
way.
but
it
was
interesting
to
know
that
things
worked
much
differently
from
how
i
was
brought
up.
i
just
told
you
the
truth.
i
told
you
the
truth
the
first
time.
you
don;t
have
to
ask
me
again.
i
never
do
that.
i
always
tell
you
the
truth.
if
i
did
it,
you
would
know.
i
took
her
out
a
couple
of
times.
the
way
i
see
it,
every
life
is
a
pile
of
good
things
and
bad
things.
the
good
things
don;t
always
soften
the
bad
things,
but
vice
versa
the
bad
things
don;t
always
spoil
the
good
things
or
make
them
unimportant.
and
we
definitely
added
to
his
pile
of
good
things.
i
suppose
i
could
collect
my
books
and
get
on
back
to
school
or
steal
my
daddy;s
cue
and
make
a
living
out
of
playing
pool
or
find
myself
a
rock
and
roll
band
that
needs
a
helping
hand.
just
whistle
while
you
work,
and
cheerfully
together
we
can
tidy
up
the
place.
so
hum
a
merry
tune,
it
won;t
take
long
when
there;s
a
song
to
help
you
set
the
pace.
and
as
you
sweep
the
room,
imagine
that
the
broom
is
someone
that
you
love
and
soon
you;ll
find
you;re
dancing
to
the
tune.
when
hearts
are
high
the
time
will
fly,
so
whistle
while
you
work.
there;s
no
more
harm
in
a
kiss
than
shaving
a
monkey
and
pretending
it;s
a
woman.
the
most
precious
treasures
we
have
in
life
are
the
images
we
store
in
the
memory
banks
of
our
brains.
the
sum
of
these
stored
experiences
is
responsible
for
our
sense
of
personal
identity
and
our
sense
of
connectedness
to
those
around
us.
it;s
a
funny
thing,
but
people
mostly
have
it
backward.
they
think
they
live
by
what
they
want.
but
really,
what
guides
them
is
what
they;re
afraid
of.
what
they
don;t
want.
sometimes
you
are
too
ashamed
to
leave.
that
was
true
now.
and
sometimes
you
need
too
much
to
know
the
facts,
and
so
humbly
and
stupidly
you
stay.
people

everywhere,
don;t

the
way
to
go,
don;t
know
where
i

can;t
see
past
the
next
step,
don;t
have
to
think
past
the
last
mile,
have
no
time
to
look
around.
just
run
around,
run
around
and
think
why.
i;d
have
wasted
a
lot
of
time
and
trouble
before
i
learned
that
the
best
way
to
take
all
people,
black
or
white,
is
to
take
them
for
what
they
think
they
are,
then
leave
them
alone.
she;s
got
eyes
of
the
bluest
skies
as
if
they
thought
of
rain.
i
hate
to
look
into
those
eyes
and
see
an
ounce
of
pain.
her
hair
reminds
me
of
a
warm
safe
place
where
as
a
child
i;d
hide

pray
for
the
thunder
and
the
rain
to
quietly
pass
me
by.
i
have
a
small
favor
to
ask
regarding
our
impending
wedding.
since
all
of
my
close
friends
will
be
out
of
town
and
we
have
had
a
previous
conversation
and
our
eyes
have
met
on
a
number
of
occasions
i
was
wondering
if
you;d
consent
to
be
my
maid
of
honor.
so
i
walk
into
the
sun.
i
thought
you;d
be
there,
but
you
could
fool
anyone.
in
the
red
water
dust,
will
i
see
you
soon,
or
did
we
move
on?
you
have
to
accept
that
sometimes
that;s
how
things
happen
in
this
world.
people;s
opinions,
their
feelings,
they
go
one
way,
then
the
other.
it
just
so
happens
you
grew
up
at
a
certain
point
in
this
process.
patience,
he
thought.
so
much
of
this
was
patience
-
waiting,
and
thinking
and
doing
things
right.
so
much
of
all
this,
so
much
of
all
living
was
patience
and
thinking.
if
i
am
to
serve
both
as
a
waitress
and
the
butt
of
jokes,
i
think
i
should
make
more
money.
she
knew
since
she
was
little,
the
world
would
not
sing
her
triumphs,
but
she
took
all
of
the
stereotypes
and
put
them
in
a
chokehold
until
they
breathed
out
the
truth.
i
never
thought
i;d
be
able
to
do
any
of
this
stuff.
but
i
can.
anyone
can
wear
the
mask.
you
could
wear
the
mask.
if
you
didn;t
know
that
before,
i
hope
you
do
now.
i
don;t
want
to
talk
about
the
things
we;ve
gone
through.
though
it;s
hurting
me,
now
it;s
history.
i;ve
played
all
my
cards
and
that;s
what
you;ve
done
too.
nothing
more
to
say,
no
more
ace
to
play.
i
never
wanted
to
be
the
man
who
loves
children,
but...
from
the
moment
they;re
born...
that
baby
comes
out,
and
you
act
proud
and
excited,
hand
out
cigars...
but
you
don;t
feel
anything,
especially
if
you
had
a
difficult
childhood.
you
want
to
love
them,
but
you
don;t.
and
the
fact
that
you;re
faking
that
feeling
makes
you
wonder
if
your
father
had
the
same
problem.
then
they
get
older,
and
you
see
them
do
something,
and
you
feel
that
feeling
that
you;ve
been
pretending
to
have.
you
feel
like
your
heart
is
going
to
explode.
mother
used
to
say
that
however
miserable
one
is,
there;s
always
something
to
be
thankful
for.
and
each
morning,
when
the
sky
brightened
and
light
began
to
flood
my
cell,
i
agreed
with
her.
if
you
are
not
willing
to
learn,
no
one
can
help
you.
if
you
are
determined
to
learn,
no
one
can
stop
you.
i
do
not
deny
that
what
happened
to
us
is
a
thing
worth
laughing
at.
but
it
is
not
worth
telling,
for
not
everyone
is
sufficiently
intelligent
to
be
able
to
see
things
from
the
right
point
of
view.
today
is
gonna
be
the
day
that
they;re
gonna
throw
it
back
to
you.
by
now
you
should;ve
somehow
realized
what
you
gotta
do.
i
don;t
believe
that
anybody
feels
the
way
i
do
about
you
now.
a
hero
can
be
anyone.
even
a
man
doing
something
as
simple
and
reassuring
as
putting
a
coat
around
a
young
boy;s
shoulders
to
let
him
know
that
the
world
hadn;t
ended.
he
who
knows
only
his
own
side
of
the
case,
knows
little
of
that.
his
reasons
may
be
good,
and
no
one
may
have
been
able
to
refute
them.
but
if
he
is
equally
unable
to
refute
the
reasons
on
the
opposite
side;
if
he
does
not
so
much
as
know
what
they
are,
he
has
no
ground
for
preferring
either
opinion.
he
spent
six
hours
examining
things,
trying
to
find
a
difference
from
their
appearance
on
the
previous
day
in
the
hope
of
discovering
in
them
some
change
that
would
reveal
the
passage
of
time.
you
know
better
than
you
think
you
know,
and
you
shall
live
to
know
me
better
yet.
there
must
be
quite
a
few
things
a
hot
bath
won;t
cure,
but
i
don;t
know
many
of
them.
when
you
meet
someone
better
than
yourself,
turn
your
thoughts
to
becoming
his
equal.
when
you
meet
someone
not
as
good
as
you
are,
look
within
and
examine
your
own
self.
what
really
knocks
me
out
is
a
book
that,
when
you;re
all
done
reading
it,
you
wish
the
author
that
wrote
it
was
a
terrific
friend
of
yours
and
you
could
call
him
up
on
the
phone
whenever
you
felt
like
it.
that
doesn;t
happen
much,
though.
why
are
you
the
way
that
you
are?
honestly,
every
time
i
try
to
do
something
fun
or
exciting,
you
make
it
not...
that
way.
i
hate
so
much
about
the
things
that
you
choose
to
be.
i
hope
you
still
feel
small
when
you
stand
beside
the
ocean.
whenever
one
door
closes
i
hope
one
more
opens.
promise
me
that
you;ll
give
faith
a
fighting
chance
when
you
get
the
choice
to
sit
it
out
or
dance.
if
you
want
a
happy
ending,
that
depends,
of
course,
on
where
you
stop
your
story.
whenever
there
is
a
meeting,
a
parting
shall
follow.
but
that
parting
needs
not
last
forever.
whether
a
parting
be
forever
or
merely
for
a
short
while...
that
is
up
to
you.
as
if
that
blind
rage
had
washed
me
clean,
rid
me
of
hope;
for
the
first
time,
in
that
night
alive
with
signs
and
stars,
i
opened
myself
to
the
gentle
indifference
of
the
world.
finding
it
so
much
like
myself,
i
felt
that
i
had
been
happy
and
that
i
was
happy
again.
the
man
who
pulls
the
lever
that
breaks
your
neck
will
be
a
dispassionate
man,
and
that
dispassion
is
the
very
essence
of
justice.
for
justice
delivered
without
dispassion
is
always
in
danger
of
not
being
justice.
when
someone
betrays
your
trust,
it
feels
like
a
part
of
you
dies.
for
me,
i
guess
it
was
the
part
that
cared.
there
are
but
two
types
of
men
who
desire
war:
those
who
haven;t
the
slightest
intention
of
fighting
it
themselves,
and
those
who
haven;t
the
slightest
idea
what
it
is.
any
man
who
has
seen
the
face
of
death
knows
better
than
to
seek
him
out
a
second
time.
remembering
you
standing
quiet
in
the
rain
as
i
ran
to
your
heart
to
be
near.
and
we
kissed
as
the
sky
fell
in
holding
you
close
how
i
always
held
close
in
your
fear.
no
one
would
ever
say,
"come
and
join
us,
caroline,"
so
i
would
then
spend
the
rest
of
the
lunch
period
feeling
sorry
for
myself
and
trying
to
remember
that
the
lonely
children
like
me
are
the
ones
who
grow
up
to
be
someone
that
everyone
wishes
they
could
be.
people
just
don;t
understand
what
is
involved
in
this.
this
is
an
art
form!
you
know,
i
think
that
most
people
just
think
that
i
hold
a
camera
and
point
at
stuff,
but
there
is
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
to
it
than
just
that.
a
great
teacher
has
little
external
history
to
record.
his
life
goes
over
into
other
lives.
these
men
are
pillars
in
the
intimate
structure
of
our
schools.
they
are
more
essential
than
its
stones
or
beams
and
they
will
continue
to
be
a
kindling
force
and
a
revealing
power
in
our
lives.
human
beings
do
not
live
forever,
reuven.
we
live
less
than
the
time
it
takes
to
blink
an
eye,
if
we
measure
our
lives
against
eternity.
so
it
may
be
asked
what
value
is
there
to
a
human
life.
there
is
so
much
pain
in
the
world.
what
does
it
mean
to
have
to
suffer
so
much
if
our
lives
are
nothing
more
than
the
blink
of
an
eye?
tonight
i;ll
dream
while
in
my
bed.
when
silly
thoughts
go
through
my
head,
about
the
bugs
and
alphabet,
and
when
i
wake
tomorrow
i;ll
bet
that
you
and
i
will
walk
together
again.
i
can
tell
that
we
are
going
to
be
friends.
can
you
live
without
answers?
all
of
you,
ask
that
of
yourself.
can
you
live
without
answers?
because
if
you
cannot,
then
most
assuredly
you
will
invent
your
own
answers
and
they
will
comfort
you.
and
all
those
who
do
not
share
your
view
will
by
their
very
existence
strike
fear
and
hatred
into
your
heart.
you
must
follow
me
carefully.
i
shall
have
to
controvert
one
or
two
ideas
that
are
almost
universally
accepted.
the
geometry,
for
instance,
they
taught
you
at
school
is
founded
on
a
misconception.
i
don;t
know
what
it
is
about
you,
but
i
feel
like
myself
when
i;m
with
you,
but
the
way
i
always
wanted
to
feel,
because
i;m
in
love
with
you
megan,
and
i
think
i
have
been
for
a
while.
i
must
have
done
something
right,
to
deserve
you
in
my
life...
i
must
have
done
something
right
along
the
way.
i;ll
find
you
in
the
morning
sun
and
when
the
night
is
new.
i;ll
be
looking
at
the
moon,
but
i;ll
be
seeing
you.
i;ll
be
seeing
you
in
every
lovely
summer;s
day,
in
everything
that;s
light
and
gay.
i;ll
always
think
of
you
that
way.

if
we
walked
down
to
the
riverbank
and
you
put
your
hand
in
the
water,
you;d
feel
the
cool
color
blue.
to
remember

you
need
only
stand
in

of
the
hearth.
and
a
winter
snowfall,
silent
and
cold
and
pure...
that
is
white.
if
everyone
keeps
asking
you
the
same
questions,
maybe
you
have
to
come
up
with
new
answers
just
to
stay
awake.

glooming

all
we
need
for
morality
is
contained
in
these
words:
make
others
happy
as
you
yourself
would
be,
and
serve
them
in
the
way
you
would
yourself
be
served.
the

there
are
some
fights
you
just
can;t
win.
a
force
can
be
so
overwhelming
that
no
tactical
approach
in
a
fight
is
going
to
lead
to
a
victory
worth
having.
when
you
can;t
win
in
a
fight,
sometimes
you
have
to
settle
for
making
sure
that
if
you
lose,
everyone
loses.
it
works
for
nuclear
weapons,
it
works
for
me.
i
just
feel
like
there
are
so
many
things
that
i
could
be
doing
and
probably
want
to
be
doing
that
i;m
just
not.
any
one
can
get
angry
-
that
is
easy
-
or
give
or
spend
money;
but
to
do
this
to
the
right
person,
to
the
right
extent,
at
the
right
time,
with
the
right
motive,
and
in
the
right
way,
that
is
not
for
every
one,
nor
is
it
easy;
wherefore
goodness
is
both
rare
and
laudable
and
noble.
since
painting
embraces
within
itself
all
the
forms
of
nature
you
have
nothing
omitted
except
the
names,
and
these
are
not
universal
like
the
forms.
it;s
you
that
perceives
reality
as
bad
and
unpleasant.
it;s
you
who;s
mistaken
reality
for
the
truth.
your
perspective
on
reality
and
the
importance
you
place
on
reality,
the
slightest
difference
in
these
things
will

change

society
is
commonly
too
cheap.
we
meet
at
very
short
intervals,
not
having
had
time
to
acquire
any
new
value
for
each
other.
we
meet
at
meals
three
times
a

and
give
each
other
a
new
taste
of
that
old
musty

that
we
are.
you
may
tell
a
tale
that
takes
up
residence
in
someone;s
soul,
becomes
their
blood
and
self
and
purpose.
that
tale
will
move
them
and
drive
them
and
who
knows
what
they
might
do
because
of
it,
because
of
your
words.
that
is
your
role,
your
gift.
middle
management
means
that
you
got
just
enough
responsibility
to
listen
when
people
talk,
but
not
so
much
you
can;t
tell
anybody
to
go
screw
themselves.
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
ideas
to
call
anything
a
revelation
that
comes
to
us
at
second
hand,
either
verbally
or
in
writing.
revelation
is
necessarily
limited
to
the
first
communication.
after
this,
it
is
only
an
account
of
something
which
that
person
says
was
a
revelation
made
to
him;
and
though
he
may
find
himself
obliged
to
believe
it,
it
cannot
be
incumbent
on
me
to
believe
it
in
the
same
manner,
for
it
was
not
a
revelation
made
to
me,
and
i
have
only
his
word
for
it
that
it
was
made
to
him.
and
though
it;s
always
been
with
me,
i
must
tear
down
the
wall
and
let
it
be.
all
i
am,
and
all
that
i
was
ever
meant
to
be,
in
harmony,
shining
true
and
smiling
back
at
all
who
wait
to
cross.
there
is
no
loss.
if
i
ruled
the
world
every
day
would
be
the
first
day
of
spring,
every
heart
would
have
a
new
song
to
sing,
and
we;d
sing
of
the
joy
every
morning
would
bring.
if
i
ruled
the
world
every
man
would
be
as
free
as
a
bird,
every
voice
would
be
a
voice
to
be
heard.
take
my
word,
we
would
treasure
each
day
that
occurred.
i
feel
it
in
my
fingers,
i
feel
it
in
my
toes.
love
is
all
around
me
and
so
the
feeling
grows.
it;s
written
on
the
wind,
it;s
everywhere
i
go.
so
if
you
really
love
me,
come
on
and
let
it
show.
the
pie
maker
considered
how
not
telling
chuck
the
truth
about
her
father
was
a
lot
like
being
locked
in
a
prison.
then
he
considered
how
being
locked
in
a
prison
was
actually
much
worse
than
some
silly
metaphor
about
truth.
sometimes
you
concentrate
more
on
racing
the
cars
around
you,
rather
than
focusing
on
what
you
need
to
do.
having
said
that,
some
drivers
actually
perform
best
when
there
is
a
little
extra
incentive
-
like
chasing
another
car.
but
be
careful
you
don;t
get
too
caught
up
in
what
the
competition
is
doing.
focus
on
your
own
performance
rather
than
on
the

i
used
to
think
that
memories
were
a
way
of
holding
on
to
the
truth,
never
forgetting
what
really
happened.
but
it
turns
out,
memories
are
more
like
dreams.
they
tell
us
everything
about
ourselves,
whether
we;re
ready
for
it,
or
not.

she
told
me
in
the
morning
she
don;t
feel
the
same
about
us
in
her
bones.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
die
these
words
will
be
written
on
my
stone.
and
i;ll
be
gone,
gone
tonight.
the
ground
beneath
my
feet
is

way
that
i;ve
been
holding
on
too
tight.

nothing
in

use
the

with
finesse
-
not
with
blinding
speed
and
brute
force.

you
move,
the
faster
the
car
moves.
they;re
talking
about
things
of
which
they
don;t
have
the
slightest
understanding,
anyway.
it;s
only
because
of
their
stupidity
that
they;re
able
to
be
so
sure
of
themselves.
the
main
thing
to
do
is
pay
attention.
pay
close
attention
to
everything,
notice
what
no
one
else
notices.
then
you;ll
know
what
no
one
else
knows,
and
that;s
always
useful.
the
rain
fell
slow,
down
on
all
the
roofs
of
uncertainty.
i
thought
of
you,
and
the
years
and
all
the
sadness
fell
away
from
me.
and
did
you
know...
i
never
thought
that
you;d
lose
the
light
in
your
eyes?
even
in
the
darkest
times
and
places
there
were
always
good
people.
people
who
would
help
others
out
of
the
kindness
of
their
hearts.
this
combinatory
play
seems
to
be
the
essential
feature
in
productive
thought
-
before
there
is
any
connection
with
logical
construction
in
words
or
other
kinds
of
signs
which
can
be
communicated
to
others.
every
time
i
hear
that
dear
old
wedding
march,
i
feel
rather
glad
i
have
a
broken
arch.
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
married
people
talk,
and
i
know
that
marriage
is
a
long,
long
walk.
to
most
people
weddings
mean
romance,
but
i
prefer
a
picnic
or
a
dance.
you
have
technicians
here
making
noise.
no
one
is
a
musician,
they
are
not
artists
because
nobody
can
play
the
guitar.
people
go
missing
around
here,
they;re
gone
for
good.
outsiders
come,
they
don;t
know
where
to

they
bring
trouble.
we
just
want
to

so

the
distinguishing
mark
of

his

tell
me
again,
was
it
love
at
first
sight
when
i
walked
by
and
you
caught
my
eye?
didn;t
you
know
love
could
shine
this
bright?
well,
smile
because
you;re
the
deer
in
the
headlights.
all
i
do
is
talk
a
big
game,
and
make
myself
sound
like
a
big
shot,
when
i
can;t
do
anything!
i
never
do
anything
yet
i
complain
like
a
pro.
who
do
you
think
i
am?
it;s
amazing
that
i
can
live
like
this
and
not
feel
ashamed!
i
think
you;re
still
trying
to
figure
out
where
you
are.
where
that
ship
of
yours
is.
how
to
get
back
to
that
life.
the
human
whose
name
is
written
in
this
note

it
is
hard
to
make
that
boat
go
as
fast
as
you
want
to.
the
enemy,
of
course,
is
resistance
of
the
water,
as
you
have
to
displace
the
amount
of
water
equal
to
the
weight
of
men
and
equipment,
but
that
very
water
is
what
supports
you
and
that
very
enemy
is
your
friend.
so
is
life:
the
very
problems
you
must
overcome
also
support
you
and
make
you
stronger
in
overcoming
them.
i
never
did
like
the
idea
of
sitting
on
newspapers.
i
did
it
once,
and
all
the
headlines
came
off
on
my
white
pants.
on
the
level!
it
actually
happened.
nobody
bought
a
paper
that
day.
they
just
followed
me
around
over
town
and
read
the
news
on
the
seat
of
my
pants.
the
dispositions
of
agents,
their
habitus,
that
is,
the
mental
structures
through
which
they
apprehend
the
social
world,
are
essentially
the
product
of
the
internalization
of
the
structures
of
that
world.
and
men
go
abroad
to
admire
the
heights
of
mountains,
the
mighty
billows
of
the
sea,
the
broad
tides
of
rivers,
the
compass
of
the
ocean,
and
the
circuits
of
the
stars,
and
pass
themselves
by.
the
gentleman
helps
others
to
realize
what
is
good
in

he
does
not
help
them
to
realize
what
is
bad
in
them.
the
small
man
does
the
opposite.
only,
we
must
allow
time.
but
our
demands
as
far
as
time
is
concerned
are
no
less
exorbitant
than
those
which
the
heart
requires
in
order
to
change.
for
one
thing,
time
is
the
very
thing
that
we
are
least
willing
to
allow,
for
our
suffering
is
acute
and
we
are
anxious
to
see
it
brought
to
an
end.
and
then,
too,
the
time
which
the
other
heart
will
need
in
order
to
change
will
have
been
spent
by
our
own
heart
in
changing
itself
too,
so
that
when
the
goal
we
had
set
ourselves
becomes
attainable
it
will
have
ceased
to
be
our
goal.
you;re
like
the
sun

someday
your
fire

grow
cold

the
pleasure
of
rooting
for
goliath
is
that
you
can
expect
to
win.
the
pleasure
of
rooting
for
david
is
that,
while
you
don;t
know
what
to
expect,
you
stand
at
least
a
chance
of
being
inspired.
come
on
now,
we;re
going
to
go
build
a
mirror
factory
first
and
put
out
nothing
but
mirrors
for
the
next
year
and
take
a
long
look
in
them.
i
had
a
dream.
there
was
our
world,
and
the
world
was
dark
because
there
weren;t
any
robins,
and
the
robins
represented
love.
and
for
the
longest
time,
there
was
this
darkness.
then
all
of
a
sudden,
thousands
of
robins
were
set
free
and
they
flew
down
and
brought
this
blinding
light
of
love.
i
guess
it
means
that
there
is
trouble
until
the
robins
come.
you
are
older
than
me.
do
you
still
feel
the
pain
of
the
scars
that
won;t
heal?
your
eyes
have
died
but
you
see
more
than
i.
you;re
a
star
in
the
face
of
the
sky.
kinda
cold,
walking
home.
growing
older
on
my
own.
feels
so
strange
to
say
when
i
am
not
alone.
faith
will
claim
to
be
a
friend
to
those
she
own
but
she
will
never
try
to
call
when
i;m
by
the
phone.
i
wish
that
strife
would
vanish
away
from
among
gods
and
mortals,
and
gall,
which
makes
a
man
grow
angry
for
all
his
great
mind,
that
gall
of
anger
that
swarms
like
smoke
inside
of
a
man;s
heart
and
becomes
a
thing
sweeter
to
him
by
far
than
the
dripping
of
honey.
i;ve
seen
it
all.
i
have
seen
the
trees,
i
have
seen
the
willow
leaves
dancing
in
the
breeze,
i;ve
seen
a
man
killed
by
his
best
friend
and
lives
that
were
over
before
they
were
spent.
i;ve
seen
what
i
was
and
i
know
what
i;ll
be.
i;ve
seen
it
all,
there
is
no
more
to
see.
there
is
an
ancient
indian
saying
that
something
lives
only
as
long
as
the
last
person
who
remembers
it.
my
people
have
come
to
trust
memory
over
history.
memory,
like
fire,
is
radiant
and
immutable
while
history
serves
only
those
who
seek
to
control
it,
those
who
douse
the
flame
of
memory
in
order
to
put
out
the
dangerous
fire
of
truth.
beware
these
men
for
they
are
dangerous
themselves
and
unwise.
their
false
history
is
written
in
the
blood
of
those
who
might
remember
and
of
those
who
seek
the
truth.
one
thing
i;ve
learned
in
the
last
seven
years:
in
every
game
and
con
there;s
always
an
opponent,
and
there;s
always
a
victim.
the
trick
is
to
know
when
you;re
the
latter,
so
you
can
become
the
former.
you;ve
got
a
way
to
keep
me
on
your
side.
you
give
me
cause
for
love
that
i
can;t
hide.
for
you
i
know
i;d
even
try
to
turn
the
tide.
because
you;re
mine,
i
walk
the
line.
formerly,
when
i
would
feel
a
desire
to
understand
someone,
or
myself,
i
would
take
into
consideration
not
actions,
in
which
everything
is
relative,
but
wishes.
tell
me
what
you
want
and
i;ll
tell
you
who
you
are.
all
that
is
now,
all
that
is
gone,
and
everything
under
the
sun
is
in
tune
but
the
sun
is
eclipsed
by
the
moon.
it;s
an
incredible
sensation.
you
have
to
be
very
quiet.
take
it
down
with
the
first
shot
or
you
scare
it
away.
then
sometimes
you
have
to
go
up
and
finish
it
off.
then
you
tie
it
to
the
bumper
and
go
home.
what;s
cool
about
really
little
kids
is
that
they
don;t
say
stuff
to
try
to
hurt
your
feelings,
even
though
sometimes
they
do
say
stuff
that
hurts
your
feelings.
but
they
don;t
actually
know
what
they;re
saying.
big
kids,
though:
they
know
what
they;re
saying.
and
that
is
definitely
not
fun
for
me.
every
breath
you
take
and
every
move
you
make,
every
bond
you
break,
every
step
you
take,
i;ll
be
watching
you.
every
single
day
and
every
word
you
say,
every
game
you
play,
every
night
you
say,
i;ll
be
watching
you.
the
pleasure
of
remembering
had
been
taken
from
me,
because
there
was
no
longer
anyone
to
remember
with.
it
felt
like
losing
your
co-rememberer
meant
losing
the
memory
itself,
as
if
the
things
we;d
done
were
less
real
and
important
than
they
had
been
hours
before.
once
there
were
two
moons
in
the
sky,
but
one
wandered
too
close
to
the
sun
and
cracked
from
the
heat.
a
thousand
thousand
dragons
poured
forth,
and
drank
the
fire
of
the
sun.
that
is
why
dragons
breathe
flame.
one
day
the
other
moon
will
kiss
the
sun
too,
and
then
it
will
crack
and
the
dragons
will
return.
and
i
thought
about
then
to
myself
that
there
were
many
things
wrong
with
all
of
us
and
all
our
lives
and
i
wondered
why
my
father,
who
was
himself
an
only
son,
had
not
married
before
he
was
forty
and
then
i
wondered
why
he
had.
i
even
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
to
marry
my
mother
and
checked
the
dates
on
the
flyleaf
of
the
bible
when
i
learned
that
my
oldest
sister
had
been
born
a
prosaic
eleven
months
after
the
marriage,
and
i
felt
myself
then
very
dirty
and
based
for
my
lack
of
faith
and
for
what
i
thought
and
done.
he
is
in
great
fear,
not
knowing
what
mighty
one
may
suddenly
appear,
wielding
the
ring,
and
assailing
him
with
war,
seeking
to
cast
him
down
and
take
his
place.
that
we
should
wish
to
cast
him
down
and
have
no
one
in
his
place
is
not
a
thought
that
occurs
to
his
mind.
that
we
should
try
to
destroy
the
ring
itself
has
not
yet
entered
into
his
darkest
dream.
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
stuck
in
one
place
and
every
day
was
exactly
the
same
and
nothing
that
you
did
mattered?
if
you
don;t
get
what
you
want,
you
suffer;
if
you
get
what
you
don;t
want,
you
suffer;
even
when
you
get
exactly
what
you
want,
you
still
suffer
because
you
can;t
hold
on
to
it
forever.
your
mind
is
your
predicament.
it
wants
to
be
free
of
change,
free
of
pain,
free
of
the
obligations
of
life
and
death.
but
change
is
a
law,
and
no
amount
of
pretending
will
alter
that
reality.
reach
out
for
me
and
hold
me
tight.
hold
that
memory.
let
my
machine
talk
to
me,
let
my
machine
talk
to
me.
this
is
my
world
and
i
am
world
leader
pretend.
this
is
my
life
and
this
is
my
time.
i
have
been
given
the
freedom
to
do
as
i
see
fit.
it;s
high
time
i;ve
raised
the
walls
that
i;ve
constructed.
kazi
tells
me
stories
about
you
once
in
a
while.
i
hardly
ask
him
to
tell
me
about
you,
though,
because
i;m
afraid
that
the
stories
might
run
out.
i
want
to
save
them,
like
a
treat.
the
awful
thing
is
that
beauty
is
mysterious
as
well
as
terrible.
god
and
the
devil
are
fighting
there
and
the
battlefield
is
the
heart
of
man.
seriously
though,
in
this
day
and
age
i
don;t
know
why
we;re
still
cutting
open
frogs
to
see
what;s
inside
them.
if
somebody
tells
me
there;s
a
heart
and
intestines
inside
a
frog,
i;m
willing
to
take
their
word
for
it.
you;ve
faced
horrors
in
these
past
weeks...
i
don;t
know
which
is
worse.
the
terror
you
feel
the
first
time
you
witness
such
things,
or
the
numbness
that
comes
after
it
starts
to
become
ordinary.
i
can
tell
you
my
love
for
you
will
still
be
strong,
after
the
boys
of
summer
have
gone.
but
the
two
men
were
not
lonely
at
all.
at
home
they
were
content
to
eat
and
drink,
and
singer
would
talk
with
his
hands
eagerly
to
his
friend
about
all
that
was
in
his
mind.
so
the
years
passed
in
this
quiet
way
until
singer
reached
the
age
of
thirty-two.
what
do
you
do
with
the
mad
that
you
feel,
when
you
feel
so
mad
you
could
bite?
when
the
whole
wide
world
seems
oh
so
wrong
and
nothing
you
do
seems
very
right?
what
do
you
do?
do
you
punch
a
bag,
do
you
pound
some
clay
or
some
dough?
do
you
round
up
friends
for
a
game
of
tag
and
see
how
fast
you
go?
but
i
try
not
to
think
with
my
gut.
if
i;m
serious
about
understanding
the
world,
thinking
with
anything
besides
my
brain,
as
tempting
as
that
might
be,
is
likely
to
get
me
into
trouble.
and
when
he
rode
past
i
seen
he
was
carryin;
fire
in
a
horn
the
way
people
used
to
do
and
i
could
see
the
horn
from
the
light
inside
of
it.
about
the
color
of
the
moon.
and
in
the
dream
i
knew
that
he
was
goin;
on
ahead
and
that
he
was
fixin;
to
make
a
fire
somewhere
out
there
in
all
that
dark
and
all
that
cold,
and
i
knew
that
whenever
i
got
there
he
would
be
there.
out
there
up
ahead.
making
your
way
in
the
world
today
takes
everything
you;ve
got.
taking
a
break
from
all
your
worries
sure
would
help
a
lot.
wouldn;t
you
like
to
get
away?
sometimes
you
want
to
go
where
everybody
knows
your
name
and
they;re
always
glad
you
came.
you
wanna
be
where
you
can
see
our
troubles
are
all
the
same.
you
wanna
be
where
everybody
knows
your
name.
the
stuff
we
call
"software"
is
not
like
anything
that
human
society
is
used
to
thinking
about.
software
is
something
like
a
machine,
and
something
like
mathematics,
and
something
like
language,
and
something
like
thought,
and
art,
and
information...
but
software
is
not
in
fact
any
of
those
other
things.
at
the
doorway
on
my
heart
all
the
leaves
are
falling
down,
and
though
i
try
to
pick
them
up
there;s
so
many
i
think
i;ll
drown.
ten
days
have
come
and
gone,
ten
days
and
i;m
all
alone,
and
all
that
i
can
do
is
pray
and
pray.
all
this
running
around.
i
can;t
fight
it
much
longer.
something;s
trying
to
get
out.
and
it;s
never
been
closer.
if
my
ticker
fails,
make
up
some
other
story.
but
if
i
never
come
back,
tell
my
mother
i;m
sorry.
it
is
as
hard
to
understand
how
consciousness
emerges
and
dies
as
it
is
to
comprehend
how
something,
the
stuff
of
the
universe,
erupted
out
of
nothing.
was
there
a
creation
or
was
there
always
something?
could
there
even
be
nothing
if
there
were
no
one
to
know
there
was
nothing?
if
i
were
to
take
even
one
step
back
right
now,
i
get
the
feeling
that
i;d
never
be
able
to
return
back
to
where
i;m
standing
right
now.
that;s
right,
and
the
one
who
wins
gets
a
prize,
only
there
really
isn;t
a
prize.
it;s
just
the
honor
of
winning,
because
all
the
money
goes
to
charity,
that
is,
if
there
is
any
money
left
over,
but
there
never
is.
i
get
to
thinking
of
all
the
things
you
said.
you
gave
a
promise
to
me,
and
i
gave
mine
to
you.
i
need
someone
beside
me
in
everything
i
do.
you;re
born
alone
and
you
die
alone,
and
this
world
just
drops
a
bunch
of
rules
on
top
of
you
to
make
you
forget
those
facts.
but
i
never
forget.
i;m
living
like
there;s
no
tomorrow,
;cause
there
isn;t
one.
you
can
know
the
name
of
a
bird
in
all
the
languages
of
the
world,
but
when
you;re
finished,
you;ll
know
absolutely
nothing
whatever
about
the
bird.
so
let;s
look
at
the
bird
and
see
what
it;s
doing
-
that;s
what
counts.
i
learned
very
early
the
difference
between
knowing
the
name
of
something
and
knowing
something.
see,
that;s
the
kind
of
thing
i;m
hoping
to
avoid.
so
when
my
little
girl
comes
down
the
stairs,
you;re
gonna
say
how
nice
it
was
to
meet
me,
then
you;re
gonna
go
drop
her
off
at
school
and
you;re
gonna
say
goodbye.
wendy,
let
me
explain
something
to
you.
whenever
you
come
in
here
and
interrupt
me,
you;re
breaking
my
concentration.
you;re
distracting
me.
and
it
will
then
take
me
time
to
get
back
to
where
i
was.
you
understand?
those
who
do
not
exist
cannot
suffer
and
are
of
no
account
to
any
viable
ethics.
if
the
true
path
to
goodness
is
the
elimination
of
suffering,
then
only
those
who
must
exist
can
be
allowed
to
exist.
it
is
the
nature
of
life
to
favor
existence
over
nonexistence,
and
to
prefer
the
fertile
soil
to
the
poisoned
wind.
because
those
who
open
their
mouths
to
that
wind
pass
from
the
world
and
leave
no
descendant,
whether
of
flesh
or
of
thought.
things
conceived
by
minds
and
made
by
hands
can
never
be
quite
the
same,
even
if
they
try
their
best
to
be
identical,
because
they;re
never
the
same
from
day
to
day
or
even
moment
to
moment.
it;s
been
a
hard
day;s
night,
and
i;d
been
working
like
a
dog.
it;s
been
a
hard
day;s
night,
i
should
be
sleeping
like
a
log.
but
when
i
get
home
to
you
i
find
the
things
that
you
do
will
make
me
feel
alright.
though
i
never
knew
you
at
all,
you
had
the
grace
to
hold
yourself
while
those
around
you
crawled.
they
crawled
out
of
the
woodwork
and
they
whispered
into
your
brain.
they
set
you
on
the
treadmill
and
they
made
you
change
your
name.
there;s
a
lady
who;s
sure
all
that
glitters
is
gold
and
she;s
buying
a
stairway
to
heaven.
when
she
gets
there
she
knows
if
the
stores
are
all
closed
with
a
word
she
can
get
what
she
came
for.
for
as
long
as
a
single
man
is
forced
to
cower
under
the
iron
fist
of
oppression,
as
long
as
a
child
cries
out
in
the
night,
or
an
actor
can
be
elected
president,
we
must
continue
the
struggle.
on
the
day
that
you
were
born
the
angels
got
together
and
decided
to
create
a
dream
come
true.
so
they
sprinkled
moon
dust
in
your
hair
of
gold
and
starlight
in
your
eyes
of
blue.
the
only
thing
we
try
to
do
here
is
show
you
how
to
make
effects,
how
to
create
certain
illusions,
and
then
you
do
with
it
whatever
you
want.
we
each
see
nature
through
different
eyes,
so
you
paint
the
way
you
see
it,
and
then
it;s
right.
and
the
only
rule
that
i
respect
in
art
is:
if
it
makes
you
happy,
then
it;s
good.
you
do
what
makes
you
happy.
you
paint
scenes
the
way
you
see
;em,
and
that;s
when
you
really
experience
the
joy
of
painting.
kelsey,
in
this
terrifying
world,
all
we
have
are
the
connections
that
we
make.
i;m
sorry
i
got
you
fired.
there
are
very
few
things
i
wish
i
could
change
about
those
two
decades,
but
there
are
many
things
i
wish
i
had
known.
i
wish
i
had
known,
for
instance,
that
such
a
long
period
of
being
single
was
in
the
cards
for
me.
i
also
wish
i;d
known
earlier
that
such
a
delay
was
not
abnormal
among
my
generation.
and
the
mind
that
has
conceived
a
plan
of
living
must
never
lose
sight
of
the
chaos
against
which
that
pattern
was
conceived.
that
goes
for
societies
as
well
as
for
individuals.
the
life
of
everyone
on
board
depends
upon
just
one
thing:
finding
someone
back
there
who
can
not
only
fly
this
plane,
but
who
didn;t
have
fish
for
dinner.
you
know,
i
don;t
know
her
very
well,
but
perhaps
she;s
one
of
those
people
that
sees
things
in
absolutes,
right?
black
and
white.
missions
fail
or
succeed,
right?
do
you
know
what
you
need
to
do?
you
need
to
get
back
in
there
with
her.
open
her
up
and
show
her
that
things
aren;t
just
black
and
white.
black
and
white,
that;s
just
for
death
and
taxes.
everything
else...
everything
else
happens
in
the
grays.
i
believe
a
man
lost
in
the
mazes
of
his
own
mind
may
imagine
that
he;s
anything.
people
move
because
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
anxiety.
because
of
the
gnawing
feeling
that
no
matter
how
hard
they
work
their
efforts
will
yield
nothing,
that
what
they
build
up
in
one
year
will
be
torn
down
in
one
day
by
others.
because
of
the
impression
that
the
future
is
blocked
up,
that
they
might
do
all
right
but
not
their
children.
because
of
the
feeling
that
nothing
will
change,
that
happiness
and
prosperity
are
possible
only
somewhere
else.
the
heaviest
penalty
for
declining
to
rule
is
to
be
ruled
by
someone
inferior
to
yourself.

out
the
front
door
like
a
ghost
into
the
fog
where
no
one
notices
the
contrast
of
white
on

and
in
between
the
moon
and
you
the
angels
get
a
better
view
of
the
crumbling
difference
between
wrong
and
right.
i
walk
in
the
air
between
the
rain
through
myself
and
back
again.
where?
i
don;t
know.
ticking
away
the
moments
that
make
up
a
dull
day,
you
fritter
and
waste
the
hours
in
an
off-hand
way.
kicking
around
on
a
piece
of
ground
in
your
home
town,
waiting
for
someone
or
something
to
show
you
the
way.
tired
of
lying
in
the
sunshine,
staying
home
to
watch
the
rain.
you
are
young
and
life
is
long,
and
there
is
time
to
kill
today.
and
then,
one
day
you
find,
ten
years
have
got
behind
you,
no
one
told
you
when
to
run,
you
missed
the
starting
gun.
it
just
so
happens
that
your
friend
here
is
only
mostly
dead.
there;s
a
big
difference
between
mostly
dead
and
all
dead.
mostly
dead
is
slightly
alive.
with
all
dead,
well,
with
all
dead
there;s
usually
only
one
thing
you
can
do.
go
through
his
clothes
and
look
for
loose
change.
it;s
like
ten
thousand
spoons
when
all
you
need
is
a
knife.
turn
me
loose
from
your
hands,
let
me
fly
to
distant
lands
over
green
fields,
trees
and
mountains,
flowers
and
forest
fountains.
home
along
the
lanes
of
the
skyway.
now
wait
a
minute.
just
a
minute.
there;s
only
one
thing
you
need
in
life
to
make
you
happy,
and
that
is
friends.
that;s
all
you
need
is
friends,
and
then
you;ll
be
happy.
so
if
you
have
friends,
you;ll
be
a
happy
person.
you
also
need
food
and
clothes.
;cause
i
don;t
care
too
much
for
money,
money
can;t
buy

you
know
what
an

in

like
when
a
touch
of
color
is
out
of
place.
when
a
shadow
does
not
match
with
its
surroundings.
or
when
a
shape
is
not
where
it
is
supposed
to
be.
the
only
difference
is
the
stakes.
mine
are
higher.
when
we
are
young,
wandering
the
face
of
the
earth,
wondering
what
our
dreams
might
be
worth,
learning
that
we;re
only
immortal
for
a
limited
time.
i
could
kill
you.
snap
my
fingers,
easiest
thing
in
the
world.
from
here
on,
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
only
reason
you;re
alive
is
because
i
allowed
it.
that;s
it.
we
have
always
done
things
your
way.
i
have
bent
over
backwards
to
make
you
happy.
i
bought
the
ring
you
wanted.
the
china
you
wanted.
the
crystal
you
wanted.
i
even
agreed
to
have
a
duvet
cover
on
my
bed.
i
don;t
know
what
a
duvet
is
or
what
it;s
supposed
to
cover.
when
are
we
going
to
do
something
that
i
want
to
do?
looking
back,
i
saw
that
for
my
whole
conscious
life
i
had
not
understood
either
myself
or
my
strivings.
what
had
seemed
for
so
long
to
be
beneficial
now
turned
out
in
actuality
to
be
fatal,
and
i
had
been
striving
to
go
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
was
truly
necessary
to
me.
it
is
a
curious
thing,
harry,
but
perhaps
those
who
are
best
suited
to
power
are
those
who
have
never
sought
it.
those
who,
like
you,
have
leadership
thrust
upon
them,
and
take
up
the
mantle
because
they
must,
and
find
to
their
own
surprise
that
they
wear
it
well.
there
are
things
waiting
in
the
darkness.

of
metal,
fire,
and

but
he;s
out
there,
burning
through
time,
facing
a
thousand
dangers
across
the
stars
and
never
giving
up.
he
looks
like
a
man
but
he;s
a
legend
and
his
name
is
the
doctor.
he;ll
come
back
to
save
us
and
this
time
i;m
going
to
be
ready.
then
just
like
that,
we;ll
be
gone.
i
already
am
eating
from
the
trash

all
the

the

of
this

the

force
of

makes
me
not
see
what
i
am
effectively
eating.
life
is
not
suffering;
it;s
just
that
you
will
suffer
it,
rather
than
enjoy
it,
until
you
let
go
of
your
mind;s
attachments
and
just
go
for
the
ride
freely,
no
matter
what
happens.
clear
the
lines
of
lint
in
your
head
one
at
a
time
and
the
king
will
be
left
standing
alone
like
a
guy
on
a
street
corner.
here,
i;ll
make
it
easier
for
you.
i
walk
a
lonely
road,
the
only
one
that
i
have
ever
known.
don;t
know
where
it
goes,
but
it;s
only
me
and
i
walk
alone.
i
walk
this
empty
street
on
the
boulevard
of
broken
dreams.
where
the
city
sleeps,
and
i;m
the
only
one
and
i
walk
alone.
there;s
enough
to
pass
around,
you
don;t
gotta
wait
in
line.
and
the
clocks
don;t
work,
you
don;t
gotta
check
the
time.
and
the
blinds
don;t
work,
you
don;t
gotta
check
the
sky.
we
be
going
all
night,
till
light.
i
have
no
idea
to
this
day
what
those
two
italian
ladies
were
singing
about.
truth
is,
i
don;t
want
to
know.
some
things
are
best
left
unsaid.
i;d
like
to
think
they
were
singing
about
something
so
beautiful,
it
can;t
be
expressed
in
words,
and
makes
your
heart
ache
because
of
it.
you;ll
face
lots
of
pain
and
despair
on
the
way.
in
fact,
the
very
road
we
walk
is
paved
with
tragedy.
but
we
are
the
ones
who
chose
to
walk
it.
we;ll
take
on
the
dirty
work
and
bring
about
a
new
world.
and
once
it;s
all
over,
we
can
disappear.
sam
stared
up
at
the
inn
with
its
three
stories
and
many
windows,
and
felt
his
heart
sink.
he
had
imagined
himself
meeting
giants
taller
than
trees,
and
other
creatures
even
more
terrifying,
some
time
or
other
in
the
course
of
his
journey;
but
at
the
moment
he
was
finding
his
first
sight
of
men
and
their
tall
houses
quite
enough,
indeed
too
much
for
the
dark
end
of
a
tiring
day.
when
i
close
my
eyes,
i
am
at
the
center
of
the
sun.
and
i
cannot
be
hurt
by
anything
this
wicked
world
has
done.
every
morning
when
he;d
come
to
pick
you
up,
i
would
look
forward
to
it
all
night
long
in
bed
next
to
you.
those
nights
when
you
were
actually
in
the
bed.
and
he
would
ring
the
doorbell
-
i
felt
like
my
heart
would
come
out
of
my
chest.
he
would
smile,
and
we;d
talk,
and
then
you
would
come
down
the
stairs.
and
i
felt
probably
like
someone
who
was
terminally
ill
and
somehow
they
managed
to
forget
it
for
a
minute.
and
then
it
all
comes
back!
life
without
change
might
be
called
anything
except
life,
it;s
nothing
more
than
experience.
yes,
emperor
charles
sought
the
past,
you
seek
the
present,
but
i
seek
the
future.
when
you
go
into
the
er,
one
of
the
first
things
they
ask
you
to
do
is
rate
your
pain
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten.
i
can;t
be
alone
here,
i
can;t
be
the
only
one
who
feels
like
i;m
going
nowhere,
just
wishing
somehow
this
dream
will
carry
me.
and
i;ll
swear
just
one
last
time,
they
say
the
world
is
yours
so
i
will
make
it
mine.
;cause
nothing
is
stopping
you,
you
could
set
the
world
on
fire.
nothing
is
stopping
you.
and
if
i
go
out,
i;ll
go
out
screaming.
you
know,
you
are
a
classic
example
of
the
inverse
ratio
between
the
size
of
the
mouth
and
the
size
of
the
brain!
what;s
morality?
it;s
the
difference
between
what
is
right
and
what
you
can
rationalize.
may
your
coming
year
be
filled
with
magic
and
dreams
and
good
madness.
i
hope
you
read
some
fine
books
and
kiss
someone
who
thinks
you;re
wonderful,
and
don;t
forget
to
make
some
art
-
write
or
draw
or
build
or
sing
or
live
as
only
you
can.
and
i
hope,
somewhere
in
the
next
year,
you
surprise
yourself.
if
any
man
is
able
to
convince
me
and
show
me
that
i
do
not
think
or
act
right,
i
will
gladly
change;
for
i
seek
the
truth
by
which
no
man
was
ever
injured.
but
he
is
injured
who
abides
in
his
error
and
ignorance.
it;s
a
sad
communication
with
little
reason
to
believe
when
one
isn;t
giving
and
one
pretends
to
receive.
pardon
my
heart
if
i
showed
that
i
cared,
but
i
love
you
more
than
moments
we
have
or
have
not
shared.
i
have
not
much
hope
that
gollum
can
be
cured
before
he
dies,
but
there
is
a
chance
of
it.
and
he
is
bound
up
with
the
fate
of
the
ring.
my
heart
tells
me
that
he
has
some
part
to
play
yet,
for
good
or
ill,
before
the
end;
and
when
that
comes,
the
pity
of
bilbo
may
rule
the
fate
of
many
-
yours
not
least.
it;s
where
the
water
flows,
it;s
where
the
wind
blows.
there
is
nothing
more
admirable
than
when
two
people
who
see
eye
to
eye
keep
house
as
man
and
wife,
confounding
their
enemies
and
delighting
their
friends.
men
always
believe
that.
with
a
law
degree
you;re
taking
on
insurance.
after
that
you
can
do
anything
you
want.
you
can
work
for
me.
in
this
world,
evil
can
arise
from
the
best
intentions.
and
there
is
good
which
can
come
from
evil
intentions.
it
became
very
clear
to
me
sitting
out
there
today
that
every
decision
i;ve
made
in
my
entire
life
has
been
wrong.
my
life
is
the
complete
opposite
of
everything
i
want
it
to
be.
every
instinct
i
have
in
every
aspect
of
life,
be
it
something
to
wear,
something
to
eat
-
it;s
all
been
wrong.
if
the
time
of
death
is
written
within
40
seconds
after
writing
the
cause
of
death
as
a
heart
attack,
the
time
of
death
can
be
manipulated,
and
the
time
can
go
into
effect
within
40
seconds
after
writing
the
name.
in
order
to
return
the
power
to
repel
evil
to
your
sword,
you
must
find
another
to
take
my
stead
in
this
temple
and
ask
the
gods
for
their
assistance.
you
must
find
the
one
who
carries
on
my
bloodline...
the
one
who
holds
this
sacred
instrument.
but
you;d
have
to
walk
a
thousand
miles
in
my
shoes,
just
to
see
what
it;s
like
to
be
me.
i;ll
be
you,
let;s
trade
shoes,
just
to
see
what
it;d
be
like
to
feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine.
go
inside
each
other;s
minds,
just
to
see
what
we
find,
look
at
stuff
through
each
other;s
eyes.
some
people
say
that
bowling
alleys
got
big
lanes.
some
people
say
that
bowling
alleys
all
look
the
same.
there;s
not
a
line
that
goes
here
that
rhymes
with
anything.
had
a
dream
last
night
but
i
forget
what
it
was.
well,
gentlemen,
the
way
i
see
it,
if
this
hot
weather
continues,
it;s
going
to
melt
the
polar
caps
and
the
whole
wide
world.
and
all
the
parts
that
ain;t
water
already
will
surely
be
flooded.
the
terminator
wouldn;t
stop,
it
would
never
leave
him.
it
would
never
hurt
him
or
shout
at
him
or
get
drunk
and
hit
him
or
say
it
was
too
busy
to
spend
time
with
him.
and
it
would
die
to
protect
him.
of
all
the
would-be
fathers
that
came
over
the
years,
this
thing,
this
machine,
was
the
only
thing
that
measured
up.
in
an
insane
world,
it
was
the
sanest
choice.
words
are
pale
shadows
of
forgotten
names.
as
names
have
power,
words
have
power.
words
can
light
fires
in
the
minds
of
men.
words
can
wring
tears
from
the
hardest
hearts.
there
are
seven
words
that
will
make
a
person
love
you.
there
are
ten
words
that
will
break
a
strong
man;s
will.
but
a
word
is
nothing
but
a
painting
of
a
fire.
a
name
is
the
fire
itself.
i
feel
that
way
all
the
time.
like
i;m
from
some
other
planet,
you
know?
like
my
soul
was
stuffed
into
the
wrong
body
and
then
dropped
off
here
by
mistake.
and
you
know
it;s
time
to
go,
through
the
sleet
and
driving
snow,
across
the
fields
of
mourning,
light
in
the
distance.
and
you
hunger
for
the
time
-
time
to
heal,
desire
time,
and
your
earth
moves
beneath
your
own
dream
landscape.
there
is
no
real
going
back.
though
i
may
come
to
the
shire,
it
will
not
seem
the
same;
for
i
shall
not
be
the
same.
i
am
wounded
with
knife,
sting,
and
tooth,
and
a
long
burden.
where
shall
i
find
rest?
open
up
your
heart
to
me
now.
let
it
all
come
pouring
out.
there;s
nothing
i
can;t
take.
if
it;s
love
just
feel
it.
and
if
this
life
will
see
it.
this
is
no
time
to
be
alone,
alone
yeah.
i
won;t
let
you
go.
it
was
a
marvelous
night,
the
sort
of
night
one
only
experiences
when
one
is
young.
the
sky
was
so
bright,
and
there
were
so
many
stars
that,
gazing
upward,
one
could
not
help
wondering
how
so
many
whimsical
wicked
people
could
live
under
such
a
sky.
just
because
there
are
things
i
don;t
remember
doesn;t
make
my
actions
meaningless.
the
world
doesn;t
just
disappear
when
you
close
your
eyes,
does
it?
you
must
know
that
there
is
nothing
higher
and
stronger
and
more
wholesome
and
good
for
life
in
the
future
than
some
good
memory,
especially
a
memory
of
childhood,
of
home.
people
talk
to
you
a
great
deal
about
your
education,
but
some
good,
sacred
memory,
preserved
from
childhood,
is
perhaps
the
best
education.
if
a
man
carries
many
such
memories
with
him
into
life,
he
is
safe
to
the
end
of
his
days,
and
if
one
has
only
one
good
memory
left
in
one;s
heart,
even
that
may
sometime
be
the
means
of
saving
us.
the
gods
may
throw
a
dice,
their
minds
as
cold
as
ice.
and
someone
way
down
here
loses
someone
dear.
the
winner
takes
it
all,
the
loser
has
to
fall.
it;s
simple
and
it;s
plain,
why
should
i
complain?
your
bill
is
ready.
you
take
it
over
there
and
you
introduce
it.
you
get
to
your
feet
in
the
senate
and
take
a
long
breath
and
start
spouting.
but
not
too
loud
because
a
couple
of
the
senators
might
want
to
sleep.
so
it;s
all
come
back
round
to
breaking
apart
again.
breaking
apart
like
i;m
made
up
of
glass
again.
making
it
up
behind
my
back
again.
holding
my
breath
for
the
fear
of
sleep
again.
holding
it
up
behind
my
head
again.
cut
in
deep
to
the
heart
of
the
bone
again.
round
and
round
and
round
and
it;s
coming
apart
again.
over
and
over
and
over.
we
have
all
got
to
exert
ourselves
a
little
to
keep
sane,
and
call
things
by
the
same
names
as
other
people
call
them
by.
i
heard
some
kids
telling
me,
how
they;ve
lost
faith
in
the
way.
they;ve
been
talking
world
peace,
and
the
wars
in
the
streets.
the
lines
on
their
faces
so
deep.
a
revolution
or
reach
out
and
touch
the
day.
we;re
overdue
child.
a
king
may
move
a
man,
a
father
may
claim
a
son,
but
that
man
can
also
move
himself,
and
only
then
does
that
man
truly
begin
his
own
game.
remember
that
howsoever
you
are
played
or
by
whom,
your
soul
is
in
your
keeping
alone,
even
though
those
who
presume
to
play
you
be
kings
or
men
of
power.
when
you
stand
before
god,
you
cannot
say,
"but
i
was
told
by
others
to
do
thus,"
or
that
virtue
was
not
convenient
at
the
time.
this
will
not
suffice.
remember
that.
try
to
understand
men,
if
you
understand
each
other
you
will
be
kind
to
each
other.
knowing
a
man
well
never
leads
to
hate
and
nearly
always
leads
to
love.
joy
to
hearts
which
have
suffered
long
is
like
the
dew
on
the
ground
after
a
long
drought;
both
the
heart
and
the
ground
absorb
that
beneficent
moisture
falling
on
them,
and
nothing
is
outwardly
apparent.
i;ll
tell
you
why.
i
think
you;re
a
lonely
person.
i
drive
by
this
place
a
lot
and
i
see
you
here.
i
see
a
lot
of
people
around
you.
and
i
see
all
these
phones
and
all
this
stuff
on
your
desk.
it
means
nothing.
then
when
i
came
inside
and
i
met
you,
i
saw
in
your
eyes
and
i
saw
the
way
you
carried
yourself
that
you;re
not
a
happy
person.
and
i
think
you
need
something.
and
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
friend,
you
can
call
it
a
friend.
if
you
worship
money
and
things,
if
they
are
where
you
tap
real
meaning
in
life,
then
you
will
never
have
enough,
never
feel
you
have
enough.
it;s
the
truth.
worship
your
body
and
beauty
and
sexual
allure
and
you
will
always
feel
ugly.
and
when
time
and
age
start
showing,
you
will
die
a
million
deaths
before
they
finally
grieve
you.
and
it
says
to
you
love
when
you
can,
cry
when
you
have
to,
be
who
you
must.
that;s
a
part
of
the
plan.
await
your
arrival
with
simple
survival
and
one
day
we;ll
all
understand.
i
can
see
you.
your
brown
skin
shining
in
the
sun.
you
got
that
top
pulled
down
and
your
sunglasses
on,
baby.
and
i
can
tell
you
my
love
for
you
will
still
be
strong,
after
the
boys
of
summer
have
gone.
if
you
want
to
hang
on
my
shoulder,
i;m
standing
here.
if
you
want
to
do
it
all
over,
let
me
get
near.
if
you
were
another
pretender,
oh
i;d
pass
you
by.
if
you
were
a
lost
weekender,
oh
maybe
i;d
try.
when
you
gonna
give
me
something
to
grab
for?
there
is
no
faith
and
no
courage
and
no
sacrifice
in
doing
what
is
expedient.
there
is
no
careful
observation
that
actions
and
presuppositions
matter,
or
that
the
world
is
made
of
what
matters.
to
have
meaning
in
your
life
is
better
than
to
have
what
you
want,
because
you
may
neither
know
what
you
want,
nor
what
you
truly
need.
meaning
is
something
that
comes
upon
you,
of
its
own
accord.
you
can
set
up
the
preconditions,
you
can
follow
meaning,
when
it
manifests
itself,
but
you
cannot
simply
produce
it,
as
an
act
of
will.
meaning
signifies
that
you
are
in
the
right
place,
at
the
right
time,
properly
balanced
between
order
and
chaos,
where
everything
lines
up
as
best
it
can
at
that
moment.
words
have
the
power
to
both
destroy
and
heal.
when
words
are
both
true
and
kind,
they
can
change
our
world.
i
would
say
he
has
quite
a
few
problems.
his
energy
seems
to
go
in
the
wrong
places.
when
i
walked
in
and
i
saw
you
two
sitting
there,
i
could
just
tell
by
the
way
you
were
both
relating
that
there
was
no
connection
whatsoever.
and
i
felt
when
i
walked
in
that
there
was
something
between
us.
there
was
an
impulse
that
we
were
both
following.
so
that
gave
me
the
right
to
come
in
and
talk
to
you.
time
is
tricky.
you
have
whole
months,
even
years,
when
nothing
changes
a
speck,
when
you
don;t
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
or
think
one
new
thought.
and
then
you
can
get
hit
with
a
day,
or
an
hour,
or
a
half
a
second
when
so
much
happens
it;s
almost
like
you
got
born
all
over
again
into
some
brand-new
person
you
for
damn
sure
never
expected
to
meet.
every
second
he
breathed,
the
smell
of
the
grass,
the
cool
air
on
his
face,
was
so
precious:
to
think
that
people
had
years
and
years,
time
to
waste,
so
much
time
it
dragged,
and
he
was
clinging
to
each
second.
all
we
really
want
is
for
no
one
to
have
a
boring
life,
to
be
impressive,
so
we
can
be
impressed.
the
painter
will
produce
pictures
of
little
merit
if
he
takes
the
works
of
others
as
his
standard;
but
if
he
will
apply
himself
to
learn
from
the
objects
of
nature
he
will
produce
good
results.
sitting
in
the
morning
sun,
i;ll
be
sitting
when
the
evening
comes.
watching
the
ships
roll
in,
and
i
watch
them
roll
away
again.
sitting
on
the
dock
of
the
bay,
watching
the
tide
roll
away.
i;m
just
sitting
on
the
dock
of
the
bay
wasting
time.
we
all
have
life
storms,
and
when
we
get
the
rough
times
and
we
recover
from
them,
we
should
celebrate
that
we
got
through
it.
no
matter
how
bad
it
may
seem,
there;s
always
something
beautiful
that
you
can
find.
living
in
the
limelight,
the
universal
dream
for
those
who
wish
to
seem.
those
who
wish
to
be
must
put
aside
the
alienation,
get
on
with
the
fascination,
the
real
relation,
the
underlying
theme.
imagine
you;re
stood
on
a
beach,
water
gently
lapping
at
your
feet.
but
now
you;re
sinking,
what
were
you
thinking?
that;s
all
the
time
we
have
this
week.
there
is
no
way
that
this
winter
is
ever
going
to
end
as
long
as
this
groundhog
keeps
seeing
his
shadow.
i
don;t
see
any
other
way
out.
he;s
got
to
be
stopped.
and
i
have
to
stop
him.
i
wondered
how
they
would;ve
felt
if
every
time
their
husband
went
in
to
make
a
deal,
there
was
a
one
in
four
chance
he
wouldn;t
come
out
of
that
meeting.
be
patient
toward
all
that
is
unsolved
in
your
heart
and
try
to
love
the
questions
themselves,
like
locked
rooms
and
like
books
that
are
now
written
in
a
very
foreign
tongue.
do
not
now
seek
the
answers,
which
cannot
be
given
you
because
you
would
not
be
able
to
live
them.
and
the
point
is,
to
live
everything.
live
the
questions
now.
perhaps
you
will
then
gradually,
without
noticing
it,
live
along
some
distant
day
into
the
answer.
well,
let
me
tell
you
something,
caveman.
you
are
here
on
account
of
one
person.
if
it
wasn;t
for
that
person,
you
wouldn;t
be
here
digging
holes
in
the
hot
sun.
you
know
who
that
person
is?
gately
can;t
even
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
a
sober
and
drug-free
biker.
it;s
like
what
would
be
the
point.
he
imagines
these
people
polishing
the
hell
out
of
their
leather
and
like
playing
a
lot
of
really
precise
pool.
there
are
books
of
which
the
backs
and
covers
are
by
far
the
best
parts.
i;ve
known
good
criminals
and
bad
cops.
bad
priests.
honorable
thieves.
you
can
be
on
one
side
of
the
law
or
the
other.
but
if
you
make
a
deal
with
somebody,
you
keep
your
word.
you
can
go
home
today
with
your
money
and
never
do
this
again.
but
you
took
something
that
wasn;t
yours,
and
you
sold
it
for
a
profit,
you;re
now
a
criminal.
good
one,
bad
one?
that;s
up
to
you.
even
if
there;s
only
one
actual
truth,
you
can
have
two
truths
from
two
different
perspectives.
a
method
to
determine
which
truth
is
true
doesn;t
actually
exist.
there;s
no
real
method
of
proving
your
truth
in
this
world.
but
believing
that
you;re
wrong
for
that
reason
is
also
wrong.
i
have
quit
three
jobs
and
been
fired
from
all
the
rest.
getting
fired,
despite
sometimes
coming
as
a
surprise
and
leaving
you
scrambling
to
recover,
is
often
a
godsend:
someone
else
makes
the
decision
for
you,
and
it;s
impossible
to
sit
in
the
wrong
job
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
no
matter
how
bad
things
are,
you
can
always
make
things
worse.
at
the
same
time,
it
is
often
within
your
power
to
make
them
better.
i
learned
this
lesson
well
on
new
year;s
eve,
2001.
and
i
will
look
down
and
see
my
murmuring
bones
and
the
deep
water
like
wind,
like
a
roof
of
wind,

after
a
long
time
they
cannot
distinguish
even
bones
upon
the
lonely
and
inviolate
sand.
you;ll
see
one
day
when
you
move
out
it
just
sort
of
happens
one
day
and
it;s
gone.
you
feel
like
you
can
never
get
it
back.
it;s
like
you
feel
homesick
for
a
place
that
doesn;t
even
exist.
maybe
it;s
like
this
rite
of
passage,
you
know.
you
won;t
ever
have
this
feeling
again
until
you
create
a
new
idea
of
home
for
yourself,
you
know,
for
your
kids,
for
the
family
you
start,
it;s
like
a
cycle
or
something.
i
don;t
know
but
i
miss
the
idea
of
it,
you
know.
maybe
that;s
all
family
really
is.
a
group
of
people
that
miss
the
same
imaginary
place.
i
think
you;re
the
greatest
but
my
dad
says
you
don;t
work
hard
enough
on
defense.
and
he
says
that
lots
of
times,
you
don;t
even
run
downcourt.
and
that
you
don;t
really
try
except
during
the
playoffs.
power
isn;t
control
at
all
-
power
is
strength,
and
giving
that
strength
to
others.
a
leader
isn;t
someone
who
forces
others
to
make
him
stronger;
a
leader
is
someone
willing
to
give
his
strength
to
others
so
that
they
may
have
the
strength
to
stand
on
their
own.
remembering
you
running
soft
through
the
night.
you
were
bigger
and
brighter
and
whiter
than
snow.
and
screamed
at
the
make-believe,
screamed
at
the
sky,
and
you
finally
found
all
your
courage
to
let
it
all
go.
a
freedom
fighter
learns
the
hard
way
that
it
is
the
oppressor
who
defines
the
nature
of
the
struggle
and
the
oppressed
is
often
left
no
recourse
but
to
use
methods
that
mirror
those
of
the
oppressor.
at
a
point,

only

so
long
as
men
can
breathe,
or

can

so
long

this,
and
this

life
to
thee.
one
essential
rule:
make
sure
the
joke
is
the
last
possible
thought,
and
don;t
add
other
words
to
the
sentence
after
the
joke.
if
you
do,
the
audience
will
think
that
your
take-off
was
only
a
setup
for
a
bigger
laugh
coming
up.
the
higher
a
man
stands
on
the
social
ladder,
the
greater
the
number
of
people
he
is
connected
with,
the
more
power
he
has
over
other
people,
the
more
obvious
is
the
predestination
and
inevitability
of
his
every
action.
;cause
when
you
love
someone,
you
open
up
your
heart.
when
you
love
someone,
you
make
room.
if
you
love
someone,
and
you;re
not
afraid
to
lose
;em,
you
probably
never
loved
someone
like
i
do.
our
worst
fears,
like
our
greatest
hopes,
are
not
outside
our
powers,
and
we
can
come
in
the
end
to
triumph
over
the
former
and
to
achieve
the
latter.
i
read
this
thing
the
other
day
about
how
when
you
hear
that
ding
on
your
inbox
you
get
like
a
dopamine
rush
in
your
brain.
it;s
like
we;re
being
chemically
rewarded
for
allowing
ourselves
to
be
brainwashed.
how
evil
is
that?
i
don;t
know
why
i
go
walking
at
night,
but
now
i;m
tired
and
i
don;t
want
to
walk
anymore.
i
hope
it
doesn;t
take
the
rest
of
my
life
until
i
find
what
it
is
that
i;ve
been
looking
for.
i
do
not
see
it.
it
is
interesting
that
people
try
to
find
meaningful
patterns
in
things
that
are
essentially
random.
i
have
noticed
that
the
images
they
perceive
sometimes
suggest
what
they
are
thinking
about
at
that
particular
moment.
besides,
it
is
clearly
a
bunny
rabbit.
expect
the
unexpected,
they
say,
but
once
the
unexpected
happens,
the
last
thing
you
expect
is
that
it
will
happen
again.
a
time
being
is
someone
who
lives
in
time,
and
that
means
you,
and
me,
and
every
one
of
us
who
is,
or
was,
or
ever
will
be.
as
for
me,
right
now
i
am
sitting
in
a
french
maid
cafe
in
akiba
electricity
town,
listening
to
a
sad
chanson
that
is
playing
sometime
in
your
past,
which
is
also
my
present,
writing
this
and
wondering
about
you,
somewhere
in
my
future.
and
if
you;re
reading
this,
then
maybe
by
now
you;re
wondering
about
me,
too.
talk
to
me
baby.
tell
me
what
you;re
feeling.
you
say
you
don;t
need
to
go...
don;t
you
pretend
you
didn;t
know...
how
all
of
this
would
end
up.
girl
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes,
and
baby
i
can
read
your
mind,
and
expectations
were
not
in
sight.
there;s
a
sort
of
evil
out
there.
something
very,
very
strange
in
these
old
woods.
call
it
what
you
want.
a
darkness,
a
presence.
it
takes
many
forms
but
it;s
been
out
there
for
as
long
as
anyone
can
remember
and
we;ve
always
been
here
to
fight
it.
i
don;t
know.
it;s
like
no
one
cares
that
i;m
gone.
they
should
love
me.
maybe
they
do,
but
i
don;t
even
know
what
it
is.
you
spend
your
whole
life
thinking
you;re
not
getting
it,
people
aren;t
giving
it
to
you.
then
you
realize
they;re
trying.
and
you
don;t
even
know
what
it
is.
i
had
a
dream
i
was
on
a
shelf
in
the
refrigerator.
someone
closes
the
door
and
the
light
goes
off.
and
i
know
everybody;s
out
there
eating.
and
then
they
open
the
door
and
you
see
them
smiling
and
they;re
happy
to
see
you.
but
maybe
they
don;t
look
right
at
you
and
maybe
they
don;t
pick
you.
then
the
door
closes
again.
the
light
goes
off.
i
know
you
miss
her,
i
mean,
you
told
me
you
did.
but
maybe
it;s
not
just
the
cooking
or
the
cleaning
you
miss.
maybe
it;s
something
else.
maybe
you
can;t
even
describe
it.
maybe
you
only
know
it
when
it;s
gone.
maybe
it;s
like
there;s
a
whole
piece
of
you
that;s
missing
too.
look
at
her,
dad.
doesn;t
she
look
pretty
like
that?
doesn;t
she
look
just
as
beautiful
as
the
first
time
you
met
her?
do
you
really
want
her
back
the
way
she
was?
doesn;t
she
just
look
wonderful?
now
don;t
you
wish
you
could
tell
her
that?
do
you
understand
the
expense
people
went
through
to
keep
you
locked
up
in
that
tower?
you
think
people
like
that
are
just
gonna
let
you
walk
away?
you
are
an
investment
and
you
will
not
be
safe
until
you
are
far
away
from
here.
i
don;t
believe
in
painted
roses
or
bleeding
hearts
while
bullets
rape
the
night
of
the
merciful.
i;ll
see
you
again
when
the
stars
fall
from
the
sky
and
the
moon
has
turned
red
over
one
tree
hill.
it;s
easy
to
get
wrapped
up
in
sharing
everyday
life
with
a
partner.
it;s
fun
to
get
lost
in
love
and
romance.
it;s
the
best.
but
holding
on
to
yourself
while
doing
that
is
the
most
important
thing.
now
my
life
has
changed
in
oh
so
many
ways,
my
independence
seems
to
vanish
in
the
haze.
but
every
now
and
then
i
feel
so
insecure,
i
know
that
i
just
need
you
like
i;ve
never
done
before.
how
much
longer
is
this
going
to
go
on,
do
you
think?
do
you
have
an
estimate?
are
you
sure
you
shouldn;t
just
quit
right
now?
seriously,
think
about
it.
i
can
tell
you;re
just
going
to
get
more
sentimental
from
here
on
out.
there;s
still
time,
you
know.
are
you
sure
we
shouldn;t
just
turn
around
and
take
you
back
to
your
island?
i
was
pulled
this
way
and
that
for
longer
than
i
can
remember.
and
my
problem
was
that
i
always
tried
to
go
in
everyone;s
way
but
my
own.
i
have
also
been
called
one
thing
and
then
another
while
no
one
really
wished
to
hear
what
i
called
myself.
so
after
years
of
trying
to
adopt
the
opinions
of
others
i
finally
rebelled.
i
am
an
invisible
man.
i
don;t
ever
want
to
feel
like
i
did
that
day.
take
me
to
the
place
i
love,
take
me
all
the
way.
i
know
a
bloke
who
knows
a
bloke
who
knows
a
bloke.
now,
i
know
you
know
this
bloke.
this
is
a
bloke
you
know.
whether
they
use
the
title
or
not,
many
lyrics
have
evocative
first
lines
that
grab
the
listener;s
attention.
often
thinking
of
a
good
first
line
can
make
the
rest
of
the
lyric
flow.
surely
death
has
found
me,
it
has
kept
a
hold
of
me
all
this
far.
my
actions
will
reveal,
only
time
will
tell.
these
passions
start
to
slip
away,
memories
flash
like
seconds
in
a
day.
how
can
you
see
into
my
eyes
like
open
doors
leading
you
down
into
my
core
where
i;ve
become
so
numb
without
a
soul.
my
spirit;s
sleeping
somewhere
cold
until
you
find
it
there
and
lead
it
back
home.
are
you
paying
attention?
good.
if
you
are
not
listening
carefully,
you
will
miss
things.
important
things.
i
will
not
pause,
i
will
not
repeat
myself,
and
you
will
not
interrupt
me.
you
think
that
because
you;re
sitting
where
you
are,
and
i
am
sitting
where
i
am,
that
you
are
in
control
of
what
is
about
to
happen.
you;re
mistaken.
i
am
in
control,
because
i
know
things
that
you
do
not
know.
i
wanna
hold
you
when
i;m
not
supposed
to.
when
i;m
lying
close
to
someone
else.
you;re
stuck
in
my
head
and
i
can;t
get
you
out
of
it.
if
i
could
do
it
all
again,
i
know
i;d
go
back
to
you.
your
mind
is
like
this
water,
my
friend.
when
it
is
agitated,
it
becomes
difficult
to
see.
but
if
you
allow
it
to
settle,
the
answer
becomes
clear.
when
another
blames
you
or
hates
you,
or
people
voice
similar
criticisms,
go
to
their
souls,
penetrate
inside
and
see
what
sort
of
people
they
are.
you
will
realize
that
there
is
no
need
to
be
racked
with
anxiety
that
they
should
hold
any
particular
opinion
about
you.
i
cannot
guess
how
many
days
have
passed
since
then,
but
i
have
endured
misery
which
nothing
but
the
eternal
sentiment
of
a
just
retribution
burning
within
my
heart
could
have
enabled
me
to
support.
immense
and
rugged
mountains
of
ice
often
barred
up
my
passage,
and
i
often
heard
the
thunder
of
the
ground
sea,
which
threatened
my
destruction.
but
again
the
frost
came
and
made
the
paths
of
the
sea
secure.
i
kissed
her
cheek
as
she
turned
it
to
me.
i
think
i
would
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
to
kiss
her
cheek.
but,
i
felt
that
the
kiss
was
given
to
the
coarse
common
boy
as
a
piece
of
money
might
have
been,
and
that
it
was
worth
nothing.
i
think
you
need
something.
and
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
friend,
you
can
call
it
a
friend.
when
i
ask
him
if
quiz
bowl
has
helped
him
in
other
areas
of
his
life,
he
seems
amused
by
the
notion
that
there
could
even
be
other
areas
of
his
life.
well,
the
way
they
make
shows
is,
they
make
one
show.
that
show;s
called
a
pilot.
then
they
show
that
show
to
the
people
who
make
shows,
and
on
the
strength
of
that
one
show
they
decide
if
they;re
going
to
make
more
shows.
some
pilots
get
picked
and
become
television
programs.
some
don;t,
become
nothing.
she
starred
in
one
of
the
ones
that
became
nothing.
you
know
the
kind
of
guy
that
does
nothing
but
bad
things
and
then
wonders
why
his
life
sucks?
well,
that
was
me.
every
time
something
good
happened
to
me,
something
bad
was
always
waiting
around
the
corner.
karma.
that;s
when
i
realized
that
i
had
to
change,
so
i
made
a
list
of
everything
bad
i;ve
ever
done
and
one
by
one
i;m
gonna
make
up
for
all
my
mistakes.
i;m
just
trying
to
be
a
better
person.
my
name
is
earl.
you
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music,
the
moment.
you
own
it,
you
better
never
let
it
go.
you
only
get
one
shot,
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow.
this
opportunity
comes
once
in
a
lifetime.
if
you;re
reading
this,
you;ve
gotten
out.
and
if
you;ve
come
this
far,
maybe
you;re
willing
to
come
a
little
further.
you
remember
the
name
of
the
town,
don;t
you?
i
could
use
a
good
man
to
help
me
get
my
project
on
wheels.
i;ll
keep
an
eye
out
for
you
and
the
chessboard
ready.
remember,
red,
hope
is
a
good
thing,
maybe
the
best
of
things,
and
no
good
thing
ever
dies.
i
will
be
hoping
that
this
letter
finds
you,
and
finds
you
well.
i
think
a
nerd
is
a
person
who
uses
the
telephone
to
talk
to
other
people
about
telephones.
and
a
computer
nerd
therefore
is
somebody
who
uses
a
computer
in
order
to
use
a
computer.
she
was
more
like
a
beauty
queen
from
a
movie
scene.
i
said,
"don;t
mind,
but
what
do
you
mean,
i
am
the
one
who
will
dance
on
the
floor
in
the
round?"
she
said
i
am
the
one
who
will
dance
on
the
floor
in
the
round.
she
told
me
her
name
was
billie
jean
as
she
caused
a
scene.
then
every
head
turned
with
eyes
that
dreamed
of
being
the
one
who
will
dance
on
the
floor
in
the
round.
still,
there
are
times
i
am
bewildered
by
each
mile
i
have
traveled,
each
meal
i
have
eaten,
each
person
i
have
known,
each
room
in
which
i
have
slept.
as
ordinary
as
it
all
appears,
there
are
times
when
it
is
beyond
my
imagination.
all
right
i
think
we;ve
been
down
here
in
the
dark
long
enough.
there;s
a
whole
other
world
upstairs.
take
my
hand,
constant
reader,
and
i;ll
be
happy
to
lead
you
back
into
the
sunshine.
i;m
happy
to
go
there
because
i
believe
most
people
are
essentially
good.
i
know
that
i
am.
it;s
you
i;m
not
entirely
sure
of.
he
became
thinner
and
taller,
and
his
face
took
on
a
kind
of
pained
expression
which
made
it
almost
interesting.
people
won;t
be
people
when
you
hear
this
sound,
that;s
been
glowing
in
the
dark
at
the
edge
of
the
town.
people
won;t
be
people,
no,
the
people
won;t
be
people
when
they
hear
this
sound.
won;t
you
show
me
what
begins
at
the
edge
of
the
town?
all
my
friends
are
heathens,
take
it
slow.
wait
for
them
to
ask
you
who
you
know.
please
don;t
make
any
sudden
moves.
you
don;t
know
the
half
of
the
abuse.
never
forget
what
you
are,
for
surely
the
world
will
not.
make
it
your
strength.
then
it
can
never
be
your
weakness.
armour
yourself
in
it,
and
it
will
never
be
used
to
hurt
you.
if
you
really
want
to
hear
about
it,
the
first
thing
you;ll
probably
want
to
know
is
where
i
was
born,
and
what
my
lousy
childhood
was
like,
and
how
my
parents
were
occupied
and
all
before
they
had
me,
and
all
that
david
copperfield
kind
of
crap,
but
i
don;t
feel
like
going
into
it,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth.
it;s
all
wrong.
by
rights
we
shouldn;t
even
be
here.
but
we
are.
it;s
like
in
the
great
stories,
mr.
frodo.
the
ones
that
really
mattered.
full
of
darkness
and
danger
they
were,
and
sometimes
you
didn;t
want
to
know
the
end.
because
how
could
the
end
be
happy?
how
could
the
world
go
back
to
the
way
it
was
when
so
much
bad
happened?
but
in
the
end,
it;s
only
a
passing
thing,
this
shadow.
even
darkness
must
pass.
a
new
day
will
come.
we
all
have
a
purpose.
we
have
a
place
we;re
supposed
to
fit.
i
fit
mine...
so
you
can
fit
yours.
i
know.
i
know
you
don;t
want
me
to
do
this,
but
it;s
what
i;m
supposed
to
do.
i
know
it
won;t
seem
like
it,
but
i
will
be
okay.
it;s
the
only
way
that
everything
will
work.
it;s
the
only
way
that
everything
will
be
okay.
you;re
going
to
make
it
okay.
i
promise.
this
is
how
i
help
you
make
it
all
okay.
one
last
thing.
it;s
important
that
you
never
ever
ever
forget
this.
i
love
you.
you
know
i
work
all
day
to
get
you
money
to
buy
you
things.
and
it;s
worth
it
just
to
hear
you
say
you;re
going
to
give
me
everything.
so
why
on
earth
should
i
moan,
;cause
when
i
get
you
alone
you
know
i
feel
okay.
the
more
you
see
the
less
you
know,
the
less
you
find
out
as
you
go.
i
knew
much
more
then
than
i
do
now.
no.
because
there
are
people
out
there
who
buy
things,
people
like
you
and
me.
and
something
happened,
something
terrible,
and
the
way
that
they
saw
themselves
is
gone.
and
nobody
understands
that.
but
you
do.
and
that;s
very
valuable.
i
was
starting
to
think
that
you
were
gonna
leave
me
behind.
that;s
when
the
pain
comes
in
like
a
second
skeleton
trying
to
fit
beneath
the
skin.
i
can;t
fit
the
feelings
in.
every
single
night
is
a
fight
with
my
brain.
it;s
so
easy
to
hate
your
brother,
it
should
be
hard.
it;s
so
easy
to
hate
your
friends.
why
ain;t
it
hard?
love
and
hate
come
in
the
deck
together.
play
your
card,
love
or
hate
can
rule
your
life
forever.
the
wonder
is,
not
that
the
field
of
stars
is
so
vast,
but
that
man
has
measured
it.
while
the
simple
act
of
putting
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
seems
to
require
no
instruction
or
comment,
there
are,
in
fact,
good
and
bad
ways
to
walk,
and
good
and
bad
walkers.
good
walkers
can
walk
effortlessly
all
day,
while
bad
ones
may
be
exhausted
after
a
few
hours.
the
truth
is...
i
think
that
we
should
stay,
and
if
-
and
if
the
time
comes,
if
the
diamonds
do
come
to
wipe
this
planet
off
the
star
maps,
i
think
we
should
fight
for
this
life
we;ve
built
instead
of
tearing
it
up
out
of
the
ground!
i
think
we
can
win.
i
think
you
can
win.
earth
is
our
home
now.
isn;t
it
worth
fighting
for?
listen
carefully,
my
friend.
you
are
stuck
in
a
paradox.
it
turns
out
there
are
three
things
you
cannot
do
in
virtual
reality.
you
cannot
die,
you
cannot
get
grounded,
and
you
cannot
call
customer
service.
this
is
why
you
are
having
problems.
have
you
ever
felt
so
strong
that
it
made
you
feel
weak?
long
days,
long
nights,
and
you
just
can;t
sleep.
have
you
ever
been
so
sure,
that
it
gave
you
cold
feet?
got
you
floating
on
air,
you
can
feel
your
heart
beat.
well
i
never
knew
this
feeling,
ever.
now
i
hope
it
stays
and
lasts
forever.
each
time
a
man
stands
up
for
an
ideal,
or
acts
to
improve
the
lot
of
others,
or
strikes
out
against
injustice,
he
sends
forth
a
tiny
ripple
of
hope.
in
the
town
where
i
was
born,
lived
a
man
who
sailed
to
sea.
and
he
told
us
of
his
life
in
the
land
of
submarines,
so
we
sailed
up
to
the
sun,
till
we
found
the
sea
of
green
and
we
lived
beneath
the
waves
in
our
yellow
submarine.
these
nights
are
endless,
and
a
man
can
sleep
through
them,
or
he
can
enjoy
listening
to
stories,
and
you
have
no
need
to
go
to
bed
before
it
is
time.
too
much
sleep
is
only
a
bore.
and
of
the
others,
any
one
whose
heart
and
spirit
urge
him
can
go
outside
and
sleep,
and
then,
when
the
dawn
shows,
breakfast
first,
then
go
out
to
tend
the
swine
of
our
master.
each
day
means
a
new
twenty-four
hours.
each
day
means
everything;s
possible
again.
you
live
in
the
moment,
you
die
in
the
moment,
you
take
it
all
one
day
at
a
time.
many
people
limit
themselves
to
leading
boring,
dull
lives
by
accepting
the
judgment
of
others
that
they
are
of
low
intelligence.
this
is
not
so.
just
because
one
does
not
process
sensory
information
and
replay
it
the
same
way
as
everyone
else
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
lack
of
comprehension
or
interest.
how
do
i
live
without
the
ones
i
love?
time
still
turns
the
pages
of
the
book
it;s
burned.
place
and
time
always
on
my
mind.
i
have
so
much
to
say
but
you;re
so
far
away.
each
man
is
tortured
by
this
dream,
but
the
dream
gives
meaning
to
his
life.
even
if
the
dream
ruins
his
life,
man
cannot
allow
himself
to
leave
it
behind.
it
was
a
strange
and
passionate
time.
some
of
our
dreams
dissolved
into
thin
air.
they
almost
seem
comical
now.
but
some
of
our
dreams
are
lasting
and
real.
it;s
a
story
of
the
goddess,
and
the
boy
she
loves.
a
love
story.
her
mother
does
not
approve
of
him,
so
she
casts
a
wide
river
in
the
sky
to
separate
them
forever.
but
once
a
year,
all
the
birds
in
the
sky
feel
sad
for
them,
and
they
form
a
bridge
so
the
two
of
them
may
be
together
for
a
single
night.
you;re
the
one
that
told
me
i
could
swing
by
any
evening,
and
so
i
stayed.
i
figured
i;d
be
heading
out
the
door
over
the
weekend,
but
i
could
be
swayed.
in
our
own
little
shack,
i
like
the
ring
of
that.
you
know
that
i
am
called
the
count
because
i
really
love
to
count.
sometimes
i
sit
and
count
all
day,
but
sometimes
i
get
carried
away.
i
count
the
spiders
on
the
wall.
i
count
the
cobwebs
in
the
hall.
i
count
the
candles
on
the
shelf.
when
i;m
alone,
i
count
myself!
and
i
need
it
more
than
love,
and
i
love
it
more
than
life,
and
i
want
those
stars
above
to
shine
this
night.
no,
that
is
what
i;m
trying
to
tell
you.
he
is
still
a
child.
he;s
a
normal
child.
he;s
made
some
mistakes
-
god
knows
he;s
got
a
load
to
learn
about
life.
that
does
not
mean
that
i;m
gonna
let
you
send
him
to
the
type
of
school
whose
whole
reason
for
being
is
to
make
him
follow
orders
by
instilling
fear.
have
pity
on
me
and
heal
me,
for
you
see
that
i
have
become
a
problem
to
myself,
and
this
is
the
ailment
from
which
i
suffer.
anna
spoke
not
only
naturally
and
intelligently,
but
intelligently
and
casually,
without
attaching
any
value
to
her
own
thoughts,
yet
giving
great
value
to
the
thoughts
of
the
one
she
was
talking
to.
from
the
point
of
conception
to
the
moment
of
truth.
at
the
point
of
surrender
to
the
burden
of
proof.
from
the
point
of
ignition
to
the
final
drive.
the
point
of
the
journey
is
not
to
arrive.
anything
can
happen.
i
got
some
good
news
and
some
bad
news.
the
bad
news
is
that
your
father
has
bought
a
condo
in
flip
city
and
the
good
news
is
that
he
is
about
to
win
the
civil
war.
i
know
nobody
knows,
where
it
comes
and
where
it
goes.
i
know
it;s
everybody;s
sin,
you
got
to
lose
to
know
how
to
win.
selling
short
is
a
way
to
make
money
if
stock
prices
fall.
it
involves
selling
stock
you
do
not
currently
own
in
the
expectation
of
buying
it
back
later
at
a
lower
price.
it;s
hoping
to
buy
low
and
sell
high,
but
in
reverse
order.
i
remember
it
ed,
that
story
you
told
me,
came
clear
back
tonight
here
while
writing.
and
you
should
know
the
feeling
never
left
me,
the
weight
of
my
heart,
when
you
showed
me
the
scars
on
your
arms.
when
i
looked
in
your
eyes
and
i
heard
what
you
said.
how
you
probably
would;ve
died
were
it
not
for
to
care
for
your
daughter
and
wife.
how
he
drove
in
the
knife,
still
your
son.
precious
are
the
dead
that
lie
there,
every
stone
over
them
speaks
of
such
burning
life
in
the
past,
of
such
passionate
faith
in
their
work,
their
truth,
their
struggle
and
their
science,
that
i
know
i
shall
fall
on
the
ground
and
kiss
those
stones
and
weep
over
them;
though
i;m
convinced
in
my
heart
that
it;s
long
been
nothing
but
a
graveyard.
i
used
to
think
she
was
quite
intelligent,
in
my
stupidity.
the
reason
i
did
was
because
she
knew
quite
a
lot
about
the
theater
and
plays
and
literature
and
all
that
stuff.
if
somebody
knows
quite
a
lot
about
all
those
things,
it
takes
you
quite
a
while
to
find
out
whether
they;re
really
stupid
or
not.
try
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
young
person
playing
willy
loman
thinks
he;s
only
pretending
to
be
at
the
end
of
a
life
full
of
despair.
but
the
tragedy
is
that
we
know
that
you,
the
young
actor,
will
end
up
in
this
very
place
of
desolation.
all
the
times
that
i;ve
cried,
keeping
all
the
things
i
knew
inside.
and
it;s
hard,
but
it;s
harder
to
ignore
it.
if
they
were
right
i;d
agree,
but
it;s
them
they
know,
not
me.
now
there;s
a
way
and
i
know
that
i
have
to
go
away.
i
want
you
to
be
very
clear
about
this:
you
were
fired.
i
wanted
you
out,
cooper
wanted
you
out,
and
you
would
be
if
it
weren;t
for
this
man.
he
thought
you
deserved
another
chance.
that;s
right,
he
fought
for
you.
space
travel
makes
you
realize
just
how
small
you
really
are.
when
you
see
earth
as
a
tiny
blue
speck
in
the
infinite
reaches
of
space,
you
have
to
wonder
about
the
mysteries
of
creation.
surely
we;re
all
part
of
some
great
design,
no
more
or
less
important
than
anything
else
in
the
universe.
surely
everything
fits
together
and
has
a
purpose,
a
reason
for
being.
doesn;t
it
make
you
wonder?
oh,
it
doesn;t
matter
what
they
say
in
the
papers
;cause
it;s
always
been
the
same
old
scene.
there;s
a
new
band
in
town,
but
you
can;t
get
the
sound
from
a
story
in
a
magazine
aimed
at
your
average
teen.
in
eternity,
where
there
is
no
time,
nothing
can
grow.
nothing
can
become.
nothing
changes.
so
death
created
time
to
grow
the
things
that
it
would
kill,
and
you
are
reborn,
but
into
the
same
life
that
you;ve
always
been
born
into.
i
mean,
how
many
times
have
we
had
this
conversation,
detectives?
well,
who
knows?
when
you
can;t
remember
your
lives,
you
can;t
change
your
lives,
and
that
is
the
terrible
and
the
secret
fate
of
all
life.
you;re
trapped
by
that
nightmare
you
keep
waking
up
into.
you;re
right,
will.
i
can;t
do
this
proof.
but
you
can
and
when
it
comes
to
that
it;s
only
about...
it;s
just
a
handful
of
people
in
the
world
who
can
tell
the
difference
between
you
and
me.
but
i;m
one
of
them.
they
say
that
right
after
god
created
man,
he
took
a
rib
from
him
and
made
a
chick.
that;s
actually
a
bit
of
a
creation
myth
-
the
truth
is,
after
god
saw
that
man
was
good,
he
created
another
man
and
saw
that
it
was
all
good.
when
the
snow
is
on
our
mind,
rows
and
rows
and
lines
and
lines.
in
the
haze
of
your
fixation,
we
all
crave
for
you,
we
all
crave.
and
you
can
kill
the
wildest
thing,
but
when
you
murder
it;s
a
sin.
in
the
midst
of
your
conviction,
we
all
crave
for
you,
we
all
crave.
i
admit
that
twice
two
makes
four
is
an
excellent
thing,
but
if
we
are
to
give
everything
its
due,
twice
two
makes
five
is
sometimes
a
very
charming
thing
too.
i
learned
from
my
parents;
mistakes,
and
your
mother
learned
from
hers,
just
as
you;ll
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
be
better
with
your
children
until
someone,
someday,
many
years
from
now,
finally
has
a
perfect
childhood.
i
can
fly
like
an
eagle
and
strike
like
a
hawk.
he
was
close,
real
close.
i
couldn;t
see
him
yet,
but
i
could
feel
him,
as
if
the
boat
were
being
sucked
upriver
and
the
water
was
flowing
back
into
the
jungle.
whatever
was
going
to
happen,
it
wasn;t
gonna
be
the
way
they
call
it
back
in
nha
trang.
i
tried
to
save
the
shire,
and
it
has
been
saved,
but
not
for
me.
it
must
often
be
so,
sam,
when
things
are
in
danger:
some
one
has
to
give
them
up,
lose
them,
so
that
others
may
keep
them.
but
you
are
my
heir:
all
that
i
had
and
might
have
had
i
leave
to
you.
before
he
leaves
the
camp
he
stops.
he
scans
the
world
outside
and
where
there
used
to
be
some
shops
is
where
the
snipers
sometimes
hide.
he
left
his
home
the
week
before.
he
thought
he;d
be
like
the
police
but
now
he
finds
he
is
at
war.
weren;t
we
supposed
to
keep
the
peace?
someday,
i
hope
to
make
it
clear
to
you
that
success
is
not
determined
by
leather-bound
books
and
ink
on
paper,
but
rather
the
passion
that
i
have
found
out
of
heartbreak
and
anger.
i
know
that
happiness
is
stability,
but
stability
is
not
a
desk
job,
and
i
refuse
to
sacrifice
my
aspirations
for
an
income
and
security.
you
are
the
night
you
are
the
ocean.
you
are
the
light
behind
the
cloud.
you
are
the
end
and
the
beginning.
a
world
where
time
is
not
allowed.
there;s
no
such
thing
as
complication.
to
find
our
way
we
lose
control.
remember
love;s
our
only
mission.
this
is
the
journey
of
the
soul.
the
perfect
song
is
framed
with
silence.
it
speaks
of
places
never
seen.
you
hold
your
promise
long
forgotten.
it
is
the
birthplace
of
your
dreams.
i
believe
in
love,
and
i
know
that
you
do
too.
and
i
believe
in
some
kind
of
path
that
we
can
walk
down,
me
and
you.
so
keep
your
candles
burning
and
make
her
journey
bright
and
pure.
the
key
to
investing
is
not
how
much
an
industry
will
affect
society
or
even
how
much
it
will
grow,
but
rather
its
ability
to
make
and
sustain
profits.
do
you
realize
that
more
people
will
be
watching
you
tonight
than
all
those
who
have
seen

the

listens
to

comes
to
a
point
that
he
cannot
distinguish
the

that;s

could
still
be

the
only
problem
with
the
treatment
was
that
it
worked
too
well.
you
became
unable
to
express
any
anger
at
all.
from
that
point
on,
any
time
you
felt
angry,
you
could
only
respond
with
a
string
of
nonsensical
jabbering.
the
wheel
is
turning
and
you
can;t
slow
down.
you
can;t
let
go

you
can;t

on.
you
can;t
go
back
and
you
can;t
stand
still.

lightning

so
i
need
to
know
something:
the
first
time
kramer
and
i
went
after
you
for
the
degas,
how
did
you
switch
the
paintings?
the
way
you
wear
your
hat,
the
way
you
sip
your
tea,
the
memory
of
all
that,
no,
no,
they
can;t
take
that
away
from
me.
the
way
your
smile
just
beams,
the
way
you
sing
off
key,
the
way
you
haunt
my
dreams,
no,
no,
they
can;t
take
that
away

me.

to

sitting
back
and
doing
nothing,
or
worse,
criticizing

does
not
require
courage.
speaking
up
and
letting
your

an
important
step
for
anyone
who
wants
to
make
anything

i
wonder,
how
you
can
expect
to
gain
an
idea
of
my
usual
teaching

you
continue

see,
i
do
not

permit

to

i
am

music
and
books
stir
up
emotions.
they
make
feelings
rise
and
clatter
and
wreck,
and
sometimes
that;s
dangerous.
but
music
can
make
you
rise
up
and
clatter
and
destroy
when
you
need
to,
too.
no
one
really
runs
away
from
anything.
it;s
like
a
private
trap
that
holds
us
in
like
a
prison.
you
know
what
i
think?
i
think
that
we;re
all
in
our
private
traps,
clamped
in
them,
and
none
of
us
can
ever
get
out.
we
scratch
and
we
claw,
but
only
at
the
air,
only
at
each
other,
and
for
all
of
it,
we
never
budge
an
inch.
alice

got
so
much
into
the

well,
let;s
just
say
your
hour
has
come
again.
yes,
there
were
times,
i;m
sure
you
knew,
when
i
bit
off
more
than
i
could
chew.

through
it
all,
when
there
was

i
ate

up

it
out.
allow
me
to
tell
you
about
some
complex
feelings.
feelings
like
the
joy
of
finding
another
pasta

the
admiration
for
another;s
puzzle-solving
skills.
the
desire
to
have
a
cool,
smart
person

you
are
cool.
these
feelings...
they
must
be
what
you
are
feeling
right
now!
i
can
hardly
imagine
what
it
must
be
like
to
feel
that
way.
and
i
don;t
believe
in
the
existence
of
angels
but
looking
at
you
i
wonder
if
that;s
true.
but
if
i
did
i
would
summon
them
together,
and
ask
them
to
watch
over
you.
to
each
burn
a
candle
for
you,
to
make
bright
and
clear
your
path.
and
to
walk,
like
christ,
in
grace
and
love
and
guide
you
into
my
arms.
i
never
wanted
to
become
someone
like
him.
so
secure,
content
to
live
each
day
just
like
the
last.
i
was
sure
i
knew
that
this
was
not
for
me.
and
i
wanted
so
much
more;
far
beyond
what
i
could
see.
so
i
swore
that
i;d
never
be
someone
like
him.
i
search
the
faces
of
the
gods...
for
ways
to
please
you,
to
make
you
proud.

what
is
it
in
me
that
you
hate
so
much?
it;s
the
questions
we
can;t
answer
that
teach
us
the
most.
they
teach
us
how
to
think.
if
you
give
a
man
an
answer,
all
he
gains
is
a
little
fact.
but
give
him
a
question
and
he;ll
look
for
his
own
answers.

the
business

choices
began.

slipped
shut
with
a
faint
locking
click
that
was
only
heard
clearly
in
the
dreams
of
later
years.
if
you;re
working
out
in
front
of
a
mirror
and
watching
your
muscles
grow,
your
ego
has
reached
a
point
where
it
is
now
eating
itself.
that;s
why
i
believe
there
should
be
a
psychiatrist
at
every
health
club,
so
that
when
they
see
you
doing
this,
they
will
take
you
away
for
a
little
chat.
i
must
wait
for
the
sunrise,
i
must
think
of
a
new
life
and
i
mustn;t
give
in
when
the
dawn
comes.
tonight
will
be
a
memory
too
and
a
new
day
will
begin,
burnt
out
ends
of
smoky
days.
do
you
think
politics
is
only
about
winning
the
argument?
that
whoever
has
the
right
fact
at
the
right
moment
wins?
for
the
first
time,
he
heard
something
that
he
knew
to
be
music.
he
heard
people
singing.
behind
him,
across
vast
distances
of
space
and
time,
from
the
place
he
had
left,
he
thought
he
heard
music
too.
but
perhaps,
it
was
only
an
echo.

there;s
a

in
the

a
great
black
pit.
and
the
vermin
of
the

inhabit
it.
and
its
morals
aren;t
worth
what
a
pig
could
spit.
and
it
goes
by
the

of
london.
and
isn;t
that
a
minor
miracle?
the
state
of
the
world
today
and
the
level
of
conflict
and
misunderstanding,
that
two
men
could
stand
on
a
lonely
road
in
winter
and
talk
calmly
and
rationally
while
all
around
them,
people
are
losing
their
mind.
you
have
a
nice
day.
i
want
to
defeat
the
me
that;s
dragging
this
failure
around.
i
don;t
want
to
forget
my
failure.
but
if
i
carry
it
with
me
as
a
bad
memory
and
keep
running
away,
i
will
never
change.
don;t
your
feet
get
cold
in
the
winter
time?
the
sky
won;t
snow
and
the
sun
won;t
shine.
it;s
hard
to
tell
the
night
time
from
the
day.
you;re
losing
all
your
highs
and
lows;
ain;t
it
funny
how
the
feeling
goes
away?
yes,
they
think
we;re
dumb.
they
call
us
the
common
people.
but
i;ve
been
sitting
here
listening
and
looking
and
trying
to
understand
what;s
so
common
about
us.
most
people
find
that
the
biggest
change
they
make
in
their
diet
when
following
the
pyramid
is
to
eat
less
meat
while
increasing
vegetables,
breads
and
grains.
these
changes
can
also
help
to
reduce
the
fat
in
your
diet
-
unless
you
decide
to
add
fat
to
these
foods.
for
this
dark
and
lonely
room
projects
a
shadow
cast
in
gloom,
and
my
eyes
are
mirrors
of
the
world
outside.

of
the
way
that
the
wind
can
turn
the
tide,
and
these
shadows
turn
from
purple
into
grey.
marriage
is
so
unlike
everything
else.
there
is
something
even
awful
in
the
nearness
it
brings.
even
if
we
loved
someone
else
better
than
-
than
those
we
were
married
to,
it
would
be
no
use.
i
mean,
marriage
drinks
up
all
our
power
of
giving
or
getting
any
blessedness
in
that
sort
of
love.
i
know
it
may
be
very
dear,
but
it
murders
our
marriage,
and
then
the
marriage
stays
with
us
like
a
murder,
and
everything
else
is
gone.
like
a
river
flows
surely
to
the
sea,
darling
so
it
goes.
some
things
are
meant
to
be.
take
my
hand,
take
my
whole
life
too,
for
i
can;t
help
falling
in
love
with
you.
the
problem
is,
willie,
is
that
charles
and
yourself
are
not
the
quickest
of
cats
at
the
best
of
times.
so
just
do
as
i
say
and
keep
the
cage
locked!
in
our
world,
every
storm
has
an
end.
every
night,
brings
a
new
morning.
what;s
important
is
to
trust
those
you
love,
and
never
give
up.
we
must
all
keep
hope
alive.
when
the
light
of
life
has
gone,
no
change
for
the
meter.
then
the
king
of
spivs
will
come,
selling
blood
by
the
litre.
when
nothing;s
sacred
anymore,
when
the
demon;s
knocking
on
your
door,
you;ll
still
be
staring
down
at
the
floor.
if
the
sky
that
we
look
upon
should
tumble
and
fall,
or
the
mountain
should
crumble
to
the
sea,
i
won;t
cry.
no,
i
won;t
shed
a
tear
just
as
long
as
you
stand
by
me.
my
doctor
said
we
can;t
choose
where
we
come
from,
but
we
can
choose
where
we
go
from
there.
i
know
it;s
not
all
the
answers,
but
it
was
enough
to
start
putting
these
pieces
together.
you
know,
i
really
think
i
can
put
together
a
great
thanksgiving
dinner.
this;ll
be
the
second
one
that
i;ve
cooked,
and
believe
me,
the
first
one
was
not
the
disaster
that
my
family
said
it
was.
those
kids
had
a
pretty
good
time
in
that
ambulance.
it;s
funny
how
one
single
thing
you
choose
to
see
could
change
the
world
and
give
mine
back
to
me
so
much
better.
love
in
the
nineties
is
paranoid.
on
sunny
beaches,
take
your
chances
looking
for
girls
who
are
boys
who
like
boys
to
be
girls
who
do
boys
like
they;re
girls
who
do
girls
like
they;re
boys.
always
should
be
someone
you
really
love.
i
can;t
make
you
love
me
if
you
don;t.
you
can;t
make
your
heart
feel
something
it
won;t.
here
in
the
dark
in
these
final
hours
i
will
lay
down
my
heart
and
i;ll
feel
the
power.
i
didn;t
know
it
would
be
people
you
barely
knew
becoming
friends
that
harbored
you.
and
dreams
you
didn;t
even
know
you
had
-
coming
true.
i
didn;t
know
it
would
be
superpowers
rising
up
out
of
tragedies,
and
perfect
moments
in
a
nearly
empty
classroom.
i
also
thought
about
my
wife,
the
most
important
person
in
my
life,
who
has
stuck
to
me
over
many
hardships
and
hurdles.
but
somehow
we
made
it.
my
wife
has
been
the
most
adorable
person,
a
friend
closest
in
my
life,
a
most
wonderful
lover.
we
loved
every
minute
of
our
lives
together.
i
think
if
it
is
true
that
there
are
as
many
minds
as
there
are
heads,
then
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
love
as
there
are
hearts.
it
may
sound
trite
to
you
but
i
have
found
myself
again
after
a
number
of
years.
i;ve
been
acting
a
role,
maybe
all
my
life,
of
thinking
i;ve
done
more,
accomplished
more,
produced
more
than
i
have.
i;ve
had
all
the
breaks.
i
have
stood
on
the
shoulders
of
life
and
i
have
never
got
down
into
the
dirt
to
build,
to
erect
a
foundation
of
my
own.
i
have
flown
too
high
on
borrowed
wings.
everything
came
too
easy.
that
is
why
i
am
here
today.
it
is
part
of
the
human
nature
always
to
judge
others
very
severely
and
when
the
wind
turns
against
us,
always
to
find
an
excuse
for
our
own
misdeeds
or
to
blame
someone
else
for
our
mistakes.
don;t
adventures
ever
have
an
end?
i
suppose
not.
someone
else
always
has
to
carry
on
the
story.
oh,
and
one
last
favor.
if
you
pass
by
heaven,
give
my
regards
to
the
angels.
but
if
you
end
up
in
hell,
give
my
address
to
the
devil.
somewhere
in
the
forest
where
the
waters
meet
lie
the
days
before
us.
spinning
on
repeat;
there;s
darkness
through
the
doorways.
silence
in
the
streets,
there;s
something
in
the
stillness;
a
distant
memory.
the
brave
things
in
the
old
tales
and
songs,
mr.
frodo:
adventures,
as
i
used
to
call
them.
i
used
to
think
that
they
were
things
the
wonderful
folk
of
the
stories
went
out
and
looked
for,
because
they
wanted
them,
because
they
were
exciting
and
life
was
a
bit
dull,
a
kind
of
a
sport,
as
you
might
say.
but
that;s
not
the
way
of
it
with
the
tales
that
really
mattered,
or
the
ones
that
stay
in
the
mind.
folk
seem
to
have
been
just
landed
in
them
-
usually
their
paths
were
laid
that
way,
as
you
put
it.
but
i
expect
they
had
lots
of
chances,
like
us,
of
turning
back,
only
they
didn;t.
and
if
they
had,
we
shouldn;t
know,
because
they;d
have
been
forgotten.
we
hear
about
those
as
just
went
on
-
and
not
all
to
a
good
end,
mind
you;
at
least
not
to
what
folk
inside
a
story
and
not
outside
it
call
a
good
end.
you
know,
coming
home,
and
finding
things
all
right,
though
not
quite
the
same.
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread.
and
so
i
come
to
you,
my
love,
my
heart
above
my
head.
though
i
see
the
danger
there,
if
there;s
a
chance
for
me
then
i
don;t
care.
now,
men,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that,
in
the
two
years
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
be
your
commanding
officer,
i
have
always
expected
the
best
from
you,
and
you
have
never
given
me
anything
less
than
that.
today,
the
nation
is
counting
on
us.
we;re
not
going
to
let
them
down.
good
luck
to
you
all.
i
love
you
like
a
love
song,
baby,
and
i
keep
hitting
repeat.
there
are
10
kinds
of
people
in
this
world;
those
who
understand
binary,
and
those
who
don;t.
teachers
never
die.
they
live
in
your
memory
forever.
they
were
there
when
you
arrived;
they
were
there
when
you
left.
like
fixtures.
once
in
a
while
they
taught
you
something.
but
not
that
often.
and
you
never
really
knew
them
any
more
than
they
knew
you.
still
for
a
while
you
believed
in
them.
and
if
you
were
lucky
maybe
there
was
one
who
believed
in
you.
when
i
was
a
young
man,
i
had
liberty,
but
i
did
not
see
it.
i
had
time,
but
i
did
not
know
it.
and
i
had
love,
but
i
did
not
feel
it.
many
decades
would
pass
before
i
understood
the
meaning
of
all
three.
and
now,
the
twilight
of
my
life,
this
understanding
has
passed
into
contentment.
i
hate
this
place,
this
zoo,
this
prison,
this
reality,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
i
can;t
stand
it
any
longer.
it;s
the
smell,
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
i
feel
saturated
by
it.
i
can
taste
your
stink,
and
every
time
i
do,
i
fear
that
i;ve
somehow
been
infected
by
it.
you;ve
got
me
over
the
moon,
and
that;s
no
jest.
we;re
miles
above
the
rest.
look
in
your
eyes
and
i
know
we;ll
be
fine.
so
let;s
shoot
for
the
stars
and
make
this
love
really
shine.
a
brother
who
lives
at
home,
and
is
still
considered
more
successful
than
i
am,
which
could
be
because
i
live
in
a
trailer
that
while
it
may
look
like
jeannie;s
bottle
is
actually
slightly
smaller.
i
spoke
to
you
in
cautious
tones,
you
answered
me
with
no
pretense.
and
still,
i
feel
i
said
too
much,
my
silence
is
my
self-defense.
and
every
time
i;ve
held
a
rose,
it
seems
i
only
felt
the
thorns.
and
so
it
goes,
and
so
it
goes,
and
so
will
you
soon
i
suppose.
but
if
my
silence
made
you
leave,
then
that
would
be
my
worst
mistake,
so
i
will
share
this
room
with
you,
and
you
can
have
this
heart
to
break.
in
the
mornings,
when
i;m
usually
wide
awake,
i
love
to
take
a
walk
through
the
gardens
and
down
by
the
lake,
where
i
often
see
a
duck
and
a
drake,
and
i
wonder,
as
i
walk
by,
just
what
they;d
say
if
they
could
speak,
although
i
know
that;s
an
absurd
thought.
the
truth
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
like
you,
us,
with
strange
hobbies
or
talents
or
gifts
and
we
try
to
hide
it
because
we;re
afraid
that
it
makes
us
seem
weird
or
it
will
turn
people
off,
but
that;s
a
mistake.
what
makes
me
unique
has
brought
every
person
i
love
into
my
life.
i
would;ve
told
her
that
davis
and
i
never
talked
much,
or
even
looked
at
each
other,
but
it
didn;t
matter,
because
we
were
looking
at
the
same
sky
together,
which
is
maybe
more
intimate
than
eye
contact
anyway.
anybody
can
look
at
you.
it;s
quite
rare
to
find
someone
who
sees
the
same
world
you
see.
power
is
a
lot
like
real
estate.
it;s
all
about
location,
location,
location.
the
closer
you
are
to
the
source,
the
higher
your
property
value.
the
essential
and
defining
characteristic
of
childhood
is
not
the
effortless
merging
of
dream
and
reality,
but
only
alienation.
there
are
no
words
for
childhood;s
dark
turns
and
exhalations.
a
wise
child
recognizes
it
and
submits
to
the
necessary
consequences.
a
child
who
counts
the
cost
is
a
child
no
longer.
sometimes
when
he
brushed,
he
felt
like
he
was
scrubbing
at
the
very
crust
of
his
soul.
each
day
i
sat
on
the
verandah
with
my
uncle
and
cousins
looking
toward
the
city.
we
had
stopped
listening
to
the
storytelling
cassette,
as
curfews
started
before
dark.
my
uncle
laughed
less
and
less,
and
sighed
more
and
more.
we
continued
to
hope
that
things
would
change,
but
they
kept
getting
worse.
this
planet
has,
or
rather
had,
a
problem,
which
was
this:
most
of
the
people
on
it
were
unhappy
for
pretty
much
of
the
time.
many
solutions
were
suggested
for
this
problem,
but
most
of
these
were
largely
concerned
with
the
movements
of
small
green
pieces
of
paper,
which
is
odd
because
on
the
whole
it
wasn;t
the
small
green
pieces
of
paper
that
were
unhappy.
i
wanna
be
inside
your
heaven.
take
me
to
the
place
you
cry
from,
where
the
storm
blows
your
way.
i
wanna
be
earth
that
holds
you.
every
bit
of
air
you;re
breathing
in,
a
soothing
wind,
i
wanna
be
inside
your
heaven.
i
see
trees
of
green,
red
roses
too,
i
see
them
bloom
for
me
and
you,
and
i
think
to
myself
what
a
wonderful
world.
i
see
skies
of
blue
and
clouds
of
white,
the
bright
blessed
day,
the
dark
sacred
night,
and
i
think
to
myself
what
a
wonderful
world.
i
became
yearbook
photographer
because
i
liked
the
idea
that
i
could
sort
of
watch
life
without
having
to
be
part
of
it.
but
when
you;re
yearbook
photographer,
you;re
like
never
in
the
picture.
time
is
a
tool
you
can
put
on
the
wall
or
wear
it
on
your
wrist.
the
past
is
far
behind
us,
the
future
doesn;t
exist.
time
is
a
ruler
to
measure
the
day,
it
doesn;t
go
backwards,
only
one
way.
time
went
new
and
got
old
like
history.
stuff
from
the
past
went
into
a
mystery.
it;s
out
of
my
hands,
i;m
only
a
clock.
don;t
worry,
i;m
sure
you;ll
be
fine,
but
eventually
everyone
runs
out
of
time.
i
know
you
feel
where
i;m
coming
from,
regardless
of
the
things
in
my
past
that
i;ve
done.
most
of
it
really
was
for
the
hell
of
the
fun,
on
the
carousel
so
around
i
spun.
with
no
directions
just
tryna
get
some.
tryna
chase
skirts,
living
in
the
summer
sun.
and
so
i
lost
more
than
i
had
ever
won,
and
honestly,
i
ended
up
with
none.
i
had
the
brief
notion
that
his
heart,
pressed
flat
as
a
flower,
crimson
and
thin
as
tissue
paper,
lay
in
this
file.
it
was
a
very
thin
one.
i
know
more
about
the
private
lives
of
celebrities
than
i
do
about
any
governmental
policy
that
will
actually
affect
me.
i;m
interested
in
things
that
are
none
of
my
business,
and
i;m
bored
by
things
that
are
important
to
know.
look,
i
run
a
show
here.
it;s
a
lot
of
smoke
and
noise
and
it;s
strictly
for
the
suckers.
i;ve
been
pulling
one
kind
of
scam
or
another
since
i
was
your
age,
and
if
there;s
one
thing
i
know
it;s
how
to
spot
the
genuine
article
because
that;s
what
you;ve
got
to
watch
out
for.
not
the
cops,
you
can
always
get
around
the
cops.
but
the
one
thing
you
can
never,
ever
get
around
is
the
genuine
article,
and
you,
kid,
are
the
genuine
article.
if
you
are
with
the
quality,
or
at
a
funeral,
or
trying
to
go
to
sleep
when
you
ain;t
sleepy
-
if
you
are
anywheres
where
it
won;t
do
for
you
to
scratch,
why
you
will
itch
all
over
in
upwards
of
a
thousand
places.
in
his
dealings
with
the
world
the
gentleman
is
not
invariably
for
or
against
anything.
he
is
on
the
side
of
what
is
moral.
i;ve
been
alone
with
you
inside
my
mind
and
in
my
dreams
i;ve
kissed
your
lips
a
thousand
times.
i
sometimes
see
you
pass
outside
my
door.
hello,
is
it
me
you;re
looking
for?
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes,
i
can
see
it
in
your
smile.
you;re
all
i;ve
ever
wanted
and
my
arms
are
open
wide,
;cause
you
know
just
what
to
say
and
you
know
just
what
to
do.
and
i
want
to
tell
you
so
much,
i
love
you.
our
existence
on
this
planet
may
well
depend
on
the
decisions
we
make
and
the
actions
we
take.
now
is
the
time
to
act!
when
a
free
man
dies,
he
loses
the
pleasure
of
life.
a
slave
loses
his
pain.
death
is
the
only
freedom
a
slave
knows.
that;s
why
he;s
not
afraid
of
it.
that;s
why
we;ll
win.
i;m
going
to
roll
my
window
up,
then
i;m
going
to
drive
away,
and
you;re
gonna
go
home
to
your
daughter.
bobby,
my
uncle
loves
you.
he
needs
you.
so
you;re
gonna
get
up
tomorrow
morning
and
you;re
gonna
get
dressed,
and
you;re
gonna
get
in
that
car
and
you;re
gonna
do
what
needs
to
be
done,
aren;t
you?
you
don;t
know
what;s
in
store,
but
you
know
what
you;re
here
for.
close
your
eyes,
lay
yourself
beside
me.
hold
tight
for
this
ride,
we
don;t
need
no
protection.
come
alone,
we
don;t
need
attention.
most
of
the
people
in
the
industry
were
young
because
the
guys
who
had
any
real
experience
were
too
smart
to
get
involved
in
all
these
crazy
little
machines.
we
come
from
two
different
worlds
but
there;s
only
one
love
that
could
make
things
easier.
my
shadow
is
always

ahead,
sometimes
behind,
sometimes

sometimes
to

right.
except
on
cloudy
days
or
at
night.
the
most
merciful
thing
in
the
world,
i
think,
is
the
inability
of
the
human
mind
to
correlate
all
its
contents.
we
live
on
a
placid
island
of
ignorance
in
the
midst
of
black
seas
of
infinity,
and
it
was
not
meant
that
we
should
voyage
far.
perhaps
i
will
die

she
told
herself,
and
the
thought
did
not
seem
so
terrible
to
her.
if
she
flung
herself
from
the
window,
she
could
put
an
end
to
her
suffering,
and
in
the
years
to
come
the
singers
would
write
songs
of
her
grief.
her
body
would
lie
on
the
stones
below,
broken
and
innocent,
shaming
all
those
who
had
betrayed
her.
sansa
went
so
far
as
to
cross
the
bedchamber
and
throw
open
the
shutters,
but
then
her
courage
left
her,
and
she
ran
back
to
her
bed,
sobbing.
i;m
happy
to
put
this
all
behind
us
and
get
back
to
work.
after
all,
we;ve
got
a
lot
to
do,
and
only
sixty
more
years
to
do
it.
more
or
less.
i
don;t
have
the
actuarial
tables
in
front
of
me.
half
the
time
she
did
things
not
simply,
not
for
themselves;
but
to
make
people
think
this
or
that;
perfect
idiocy
she
knew
for
no
one
was
ever
for
a
second
taken
in.
the
man
who
lies
to
himself
and
listens
to
his
own
lie
comes
to
such
a
pass
that
he
cannot
distinguish
the
truth
within
him,
or
around
him,
and
so
loses
all
respect
for
himself
and
for
others.
and
having
no
respect
he
ceases
to
love,
and
in
order
to
occupy
and
distract
himself
without
love
he
gives
way
to
passions
and
coarse
pleasures,
and
sinks
to
bestiality
in
his
vices,
all
from
continual
lying
to
other
men
and
to
himself.
and
i
wonder
if
everything
could
ever
feel
this
real
forever,
if
anything
could
ever
be
this
good
again.
perhaps
the
most
serious
way
in
which
parasites
that
are
usually
harmless
may
become
of
great
importance
is
illustrated
by
their
introduction
into
new
regions
or,
as
is
more
often
the
case,
by
the
introduction
of
new
hosts
into
the
region
where
the
parasites
are
found.
under
normal
conditions
the
animals
of
a
given
region
are
usually
immune
to
the
parasites
of
the
same
region.
the
alternative
to
binge
travel
-

mini
retirement
-
entails
relocating
to

place

one
to
six
months
before
going
home
or
moving
to
another
locale.
rather
than
seeking
to
see
the
world,
we
aim
to
experience
it
at
a
speed
that
lets
it
change
us.

your
ego

fair.
you
really
know
how
to
make
me
cry
when
you
give
me
those
ocean
eyes.
i;m
scared.
i;ve
never
fallen
from
quite
this
high.

into

those

eyes.
have
you
ever
fixed
a
nose
before?
no,
but
i;ve
done
several
toes,
and
how
different
are
they
really?
and
some
things
that
should
not
have
been
forgotten
were
lost.

became
legend.
legend
became
myth.
and
for
two
and
a
half
thousand
years,
the
ring
passed
out
of
all
knowledge.
what
you
are,
and
who
you
are

provide
greater
clarity
about
where
you
have
been
and
where
you
are

although
one
distinguishes
spiritual
from
physical

the
ultimate
unification
of

the
consequence

and

-

how
about
tellers?
you
take
tellers.
they
never
tell
you
anything.
they
always
ask
questions.
and
interest,
there;s
nothing
interesting
about
it
at
all.
it;s
boring.
oh
and
then
the
trust
department,
they
got
all
the

down
to

kind
of

that?

he

your

fought
for

maybe
he

is
he;s
gone

she;s
got
a
smile
that,
it
seems
to
me,
reminds
me
of
childhood
memories,
where
everything
was
as
fresh
as
the
bright
blue
sky.
now
and
then
when
i
see
her
face
she
takes
me
away
to
that
special
place
and
if
i;d
stare
too
long
i;d
probably
break
down
and
cry.
legend
has
it
this
bridge
was
constructed
by
a
young
man
and
woman
who
lived
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river.
the
two
fell
in
love
and
constructed
the
bridge
so
they
could
meet
in
the
middle
and
share
what
would
be
their
first
kiss.
from
that
day
on
it
would
be
known
appropriately
as
the
kissing
bridge
and
if
people
had
just
stuck
to
the
kissing

would
have
been

to
avoid

heck
of
a

you
might
walk
when
you
first
enter
a
world
and
are
unfamiliar
with
the

but
once
you
gain
knowledge
of
your
surroundings,
it;s
easier
to
run!
i
know
you
have
received
orders
from
our
commandant,
which
he
has
received
from
his
superiors,
to
dispose
of
the
population
of
this

now
would
be
the
time
to
do
it.
here

are;
they;re
all

this
is
your

you
could
leave,
and
return
to
your
families
as
men
instead
of
murderers.
okay,
listen
to
me,
judy.
i
don;t
mind
that
you;re
working
with
my
husband,
or
that
you
even
bake
him
those
little
treats.
that
you
do.

if
you;re
going
to
start
acting

him,
you
better
put

you
sound

has

the
old
man
told
us
to
go
back
to
other
parts
of

there
was

that
afternoon.
stranded
in
this

while
the
whole
world
was
converging
elsewhere,
we
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
children
playing
among
heroic
men.
it;s
been
a
long
day
without
you,
my
friend,
and
i;ll
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
see
you
again.
we;ve
come
a
long
way
from
where
we
began.
once
in
a
lifetime
there
comes
a
motion
picture
which
changes
the
whole
history
of
motion
pictures.
a
picture
so
stunning
in
its
effect,
so
vast
in
its
impact
that
it
profoundly
affects
the
lives
of
all
who
see
it.

ishmael.
some
years
ago
-
never
mind
how
long
precisely
-
having
little
or
no
money
in
my
purse,
and
nothing
particular
to
interest
me
on
shore,
i
thought
i
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
watery
part
of
the
world.
i
used
to
kid
her
once
in
a
while
because
she
wouldn;t
take
her
kings
out
of
the
back

he
pushes
people
away
before
they
get
a
chance
to
leave
him.
it;s
a
defense
mechanism.
and
for
twenty
years
he;s
been
alone
because
of
that.
and
if
you
push
him
right
now,
it;s
gonna
be
the
same
thing
all
over
again
and
i;m
not
gonna
let
that
happen
to
him.
but
you
know
that
when
the
truth
is
told,
you
can
get
what
you
want
or
you
can
just
get
old;
you;re
gonna
kick
off
before
you
even
get
halfway
through.
when
will
you
realize?
vienna
waits
for
you.
let
me
tell
you
what;s
gonna
happen,
officer
grimly.
i;m
going
to
roll
my
window
up,
then
i;m
going
to
drive
away,
and
you;re
gonna
go
home
to
your
daughter,
and
every
few
years,
you;re
gonna
look
at
her
face
and
know
that
you;re
alive
because
you
chose
not
to
go
down
a
certain
road
on
a
certain
night.
that
you
chose
to
walk
into
the
light
instead
of
into
the
darkness.
one
day
when
i
was
able
to
get
up,
i
decided
to
look
at
myself
in
the
mirror
on
the
opposite
wall.
i
had
not
seen
myself
since
the
ghetto.
from
the
depths
of
the
mirror,
a
corpse
was
contemplating
me.
the
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
gazed
at
me
has
never
left
me.
grab
your
coat
and
get
your
hat,
leave
your
worry
on
the
doorstep.
just
direct
your
feet
to
the
sunny
side
of
the
street.
can;t
you
hear
a
pitter-pat?
and
that
happy
tune
is
your
step.
life
can
be
so
sweet
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street.
come
sail
your
ships
around
me
and
burn
your
bridges
down.
we
make
a
little
history,
baby,
every
time
you
come
around.
come
loose
your
dogs
upon
me
and
let
your
hair
hang
down.
you
are
a
little
mystery
to
me
every
time
you
come
around.
we
talk
about
it
all
night
long,
we
define
our
moral
ground.
but
when
i
crawl
into
your
arms
everything
comes
tumbling
down.
a
melancholy
air
can
never
be
the
right
thing;
what
you
want
is
a
bored
air.
if
you
are
melancholy,
it
must
be
because
you
want
something,
there
is
something
in
which
you
have
not
succeeded.
it
is
showing
your
inferiority.
if
you
are
bored,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
the
person
who
has
tried
in
vain
to
please
you
who
is
inferior.
and
let;s
remember
that
science
isn;t
a
game
of
chess,
although
chess
may
be
played
scientifically.
the
other
thing
to
remember
is
that
if
we
are
to
organize
the
masses
we
must
first
organize
ourselves.
we
want
a
good
life
with
a
nose
for
things,
the
fresh
wind
and
bright
sky
to
endure
my
suffering.
i;m
a
hole
without
a
key
if
i
break
my
tongue.
oh,
speaking
of
tomorrow,
how
will
it
ever
come?
the
ultimate
way
to
compose
is
to
be
able
to
keyboard
as
fast
as
you
can
think.
this
is
not
easy
to
do,
but
your
goal
should
be
at
least
to
develop
the
ability
to
think
of
the
word
and
have
the
appropriate
fingers
tap
the
appropriate
keys
without
interrupting
the
thinking
process
so
your
thoughts
can
flow
onto
the
screen.
i
close
my
eyes
only
for
a
moment,
and
the
moment;s
gone.
all
my
dreams
pass
before
my
eyes,
a
curiosity.
dust
in
the
wind,
all
they
are
is
dust
in
the
wind.
he
heard
the
sound
of
waves
striking
the
shore,
and
it
was
as
though
the
surging
of
his
young
blood
was
keeping
time
with
the
movement
of
the
sea;s
great
tides.
it
was
doubtless
because
nature
itself
satisfied
his
need
that
shinji
felt
no
particular
lack
of
music
in
his
everyday
life.
you
know
that
death
is
the
most
beautiful
part
of
life,
right?
death
is
beautiful
because
we
all
fear
death.
and
fear
is
the
most
amazing
emotion
of
all
because
it
creates
complete
awareness.
it
brings
you
to
now.
it
makes
you
truly
present.
and
when
we
are
truly
present,
it;s
nirvana.
it;s
pure
love.
so
death
is
pure
love.
you
see,
i;m
moving
on
fast.
finally
got
the
pass,
gonna
leave
this
thing
behind.
you
cut
deep,
but
you
don;t
see,
you
don;t
care.
anything
high-tech,
you
can
break
into.
with
a
radio,
you
can;t
trace
where
it
comes
from.
you
can;t
trace
who;s
listening.
the
radio
is
how
we
talk
to
each
other,
how
all
spies
talk
to
each
other
all
around
the
world.
you
listen
every
day
and
every
day
there;s
no
message
-
years
go
by
and
decades
and
there;s
no
message
-
and
then
one
day
you
listen
and
the
code
word
comes.
let
me
tell
you
why
you;re
here.
you;re
here
because
you
know
something.
what
you
know
you
can;t
explain,
but
you
feel
it.
you;ve
felt
it
your
entire
life,
that
there;s
something
wrong
with
the
world.
you
don;t
know
what
it
is,
but
it;s
there,
like
a
splinter
in
your
mind,
driving
you
mad.
it
is
this
feeling
that
has
brought
you
to
me.
do
you
know
what
i;m
talking
about?
he
told
me
this
whole
story
about
when
a
jew
is
on
the
show
he
always
loses
to
a
gentile
and
then
the
gentile
wins
more
money.
i
mean
who
could
dream
up
a
scheme
like
that?
look
round
at
the
courses
of
the
stars,
as
if
thou
wert
going
along
with
them;
and
constantly
consider
the
changes
of
the
elements
into
one
another;
for
such
thoughts
purge
away
the
filth
of
the
terrene
life.
i
am
learning
about
twenty
new
italian
words
a
day.
where
am
i
getting
the
brain
space
to
store
these
words?
i;m
hoping
that
maybe
my
mind
has
decided
to
clear
out
some
old
negative
thoughts
and
sad
memories
and
replace
them
with
these
shiny
new
words.
well
i
woke
in
mid-afternoon
;cause
that;s
when
it
all
hurts
the
most.
i
dream
i
never
know
anyone
at
the
party
and
i;m
always
the
host.
if
dreams
are
like
movies,
then
memories
are
films
about
ghosts.
you
can
never
escape,
you
can
only
move
south
down
the
coast.
the
idea
behind
each
one
was
we
took
a
film
that
we
like
and
made
the
title
stupider.
and
then
made
a
new
film
to
reflect
the
new
stupid
title.
it;s
a
formula
that
only
produces
horrible
films,
but
for
some
reason
we
kept
using
it.
he;s
been
known
to
obsess
over
typos
in
e-mails
to
the
point
that
he
could
not
see
past
the
errors
and
read
the
actual
content
of
the

even
in
social
settings,

might
get
up
from
the
dinner
table
without
a

of

simply
because
he;s
not
willing
to
suffer

or
small
talk.
are
you,
are
you
coming
to
the
tree?
where
they
strung
up
a
man,
they
say
who
murdered
three.
strange
things
did
happen
here,
no
stranger
would
it
be,
if
we
met
at
midnight
in
the
hanging
tree.
when
we;re
young,
we;re
taught
the
distinction
between
a
hero
and
a
villain,
good
and
evil,
a
savior
and
a
lost
cause.
but
what
if
the
only
real
difference
is
just
who;s
telling
the
story?
there;s
something
we
need
to
find,
something
hidden
here
in
the
castle
and
it
may
help
us
defeat
you
know
who.
right
what
is
it?
we
don;t
know.
where
is
it?
we
don;t
know
that
either,
i
realized
that;s
not
much
to
go
on.
that;s
nothing
to
go
on.
i
don;t
know
what
you;re
talking
about.
i
don;t
agree
with
what
you;re
saying.
and
you;re
trying
to
wind
me
up.
but
i;m
very,
very
angry,
and
i
want
this
conversation
to
stop
right
away.
so
i
can;t
live
with
you
or
without
you,
and
don;t
seem
to
know
my
own
mind.
an
ox
wanders
off
and
you
spend
time
looking
for
it.
they
live
meaningless
lives.
they
waste
their
precious
days
over
nothing.
no
matter
how
old
they
get,
they;ll
continue
to
say
"my
real
life
hasn;t
started
yet.
the
real
me
is
still
asleep,
so
that;s
why
my
life
is
such
garbage."
they
continue
to
tell
themselves
that.
and
they
age.
and
on
their
deathbeds,
they
will
finally
realize.
the
life
they
lived
was
the
real
thing.
he
thinks
he;s
got
free
will,
but
really
he;s
trapped
in
a
maze,
in
a
system.
all
he
can
do
is
consume,
he;s
pursued
by
demons
that
are
probably
just
in
his
own
head,
and
even
if
he
does
manage
to
escape
by
slipping
out
one
side
of
the
maze,
what
happens?
he
comes
right
back
in
the
other
side.
people
think
it;s
a
happy
game.
it;s
not
a
happy
game.
it;s
a
nightmare
world,
and
the
worst
thing
is,
it;s
real
and
we
live
in
it.
it;s
all
code.
if
you
listen
closely,
you
can

not
meddle

if

what
you
want
every
time.
no
struggle,
no
hard
work,
no
challenges,
no
hard
work
required.
some
of
you
saying
that
would
be
great.
you
would
be
weak
and
then
when
something
hard
comes
up
in
your
life
you
wouldn;t
know
how
to
handle
it
because
you
have
never
gone
through
anything
that
strengthens
you.
you
cannot
grow
without
struggle,
you
cannot
develop
strength
without
resistance,
without
challenging
yourself,
without
struggle.
pain
is
your
friend,
maybe
not
in
the
moment,
but
for
the
evolution
of
your
soul,
for
the
long
term
benefit
of
you,
as
a
stronger
human
being.
i
think
human
beings
must
have
faith
or
must
look
for
faith,
otherwise
our
life
is
empty.
to
live
and
not
to
know
why
the
cranes
fly,
why
children
are
born,
why
there
are
stars
in
the
sky.
you
must
know
why
you
are
alive,
or
else
everything
is
nonsense,
just
blowing
in
the
wind.
i
must;ve
forgot,
you
can;t
trust
me.
i;m
open
a
moment
and
closed
when
you
show
it.
before
you
know
it,
i;m
off
at
sea.
and
now
that
i
write
and
think
about
it,
and
the
story
unfolds;
you
should
take
my
life,
you
should
take
my
soul.
when
we
got
to
the
mint
i
parked
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
casino,
around
a
corner
from
the
parking
lot.
no
point
risking
a
scene
in
the
lobby,
i
thought.
you
can
be
sure
of
succeeding
in
your
attacks
if
you
only
attack
places
which
are
undefended.
you
can
ensure
the
safety
of
your
defense
if
you
only
hold
positions
that
cannot
be
attacked.
you
and
i,
we;ve
been
through
a
lot
together.
i
look
back
and
i
just,
uh,
i
appreciate
all
the
times
that...
that
we
had
together,
you
know?
i
remember
just
going
down
in
my
room
and,
you
know,
dealing...
tryin;
to
deal
with
some
things.
and
you;ve
always
been
there
for
that.
always.
just
me
and
you.
all
time
is
all
time.
it
does
not
change.
it
does
not
lend
itself
to
warnings
or
explanations.
it
simply
is.
take
it
moment
by
moment,
and
you
will
find
that
we
are
all,
as
i;ve
said
before,
bugs
in
amber.
well,
if
some
people
get
upset
because
they
feel
they
have
a
hold
on
some
things,
i;m
merely
acting
as
a
gentle
reminder:
here
today,
gone
tomorrow,
so
don;t
get
attached
to
things
now.
with
that
in
mind,
i;m
not
against
collecting
stuff.
i
don;t
like
you,
but
i
love
you.
seems
that
i;m
always
thinking
of
you.
oh,
you
treat
me
badly,
i
love
you
madly,
you
really
got
a
hold
on
me.
i

need

want
to
kiss
you,
but
i
need
to.
oh,
you
do
me
wrong
now,
my
love
is
strong
now,
you
really
got
a
hold
on
me.
he
looked
at
her
as
a
man
might
look
at
a
faded
flower
he
had
plucked,
in
which
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
trace
the
beauty
that
had
made
him
pick
and
so
destroy
it.
the
first
time
i
made
coffee
for
just
myself,
i
made
too
much
of
it,
not
being
used
to
being
the
only
person
there.
and
i
wandered
through
the
house
like
a
little
boy
lost
at
the
mall,
and
an
astronaut
could;ve
seen
the
hunger
in
my
eyes
from
space.
what
could
there
be
about
a
shadow
that
was
so
terrible
that
she
knew
that
there
had
never
been
before
or
ever
would
be
again,
anything
that
would
chill
her
with
a
fear
that
was
beyond
shuddering,
beyond
crying
or
screaming,
beyond
the
possibility
of
comfort?
they

an
apartment
with
deep
pile

and
a
couple
of
paintings
from
sears.
a
big
waterbed
that
they
bought
with
the
bread
they
had
saved
for
a
couple
of
years.
they
started
to
fight
when
the
money
got
tight
and
they
just
didn;t
count
on
the
tears.
sometimes
it
seems
like
we;re
all
living
in
some
kind
of
prison,
and
the
crime
is
how
much
we
hate
ourselves.
it;s
good
to
get
really
dressed
up
once
in
a
while,
and
admit
the
truth
-
that
when
you
really
look
closely,
people
are
so
strange
and
so
complicated
that
they;re
actually
beautiful.
possibly
even
me.
let;s
face
it:
there
are
tons
of
things
in
your
home
and
life
that
you
don;t
use,
need,
or
even
particularly
want.
whether
you
realize
it
or
not,
this
clutter
creates
indecision
and
distractions,
consuming
attention
and
making
unfettered
happiness
a
real
chore.
it;s
hard
to
believe
when
your
mind
is
lost
and
in
need,
and
all
you
can
picture
is
a
memory
inside
of
someone
else;s
sheets.
a
prayer
that
nothing
will
keep;
a
hope
that
light
will
seek
before
the
dark
sinks
too
deep,
or
at
least
the
sinking
feeling
inside
of
me
will
decrease
when
the
release
of
perceived
dreams
burn
in
the
flame
of
feeling
free.
the
journey
to
greatness
starts
with
looking
inside
ourselves.
i
define
greatness
as
the
intersection
of
passion,
purpose
and
potential.
it
is
that
place
where
you
are
radically
passionate
about
what
you;re
doing,
you
are
naturally
gifted
to
do
that
thing,
and
you
are
using
that
passion
and
those
gifts
to
solve
problems
and
serve
others.
living
in
the
center
of
your
point
of
greatness
allows
your
best
and
highest
possible
contribution
to
our
world.
he

someone
needs
to
make
a
record
of
the
things
that
will
happen
because
the
grown-ups
will
be
too
busy.
i;m
not
sure
what
he
thinks
is
going
to
happen,
but
i;ve
decided
i;m
going
to
write
in
it
every
day
if
i
can.
i
want
to
explain
things
to
you
as
if
i;m
writing
a
storybook,
like
the
jungle
book
except
without
all
the
animals.
i
want
to
make
it
real
so
you
can
imagine
it.
i
want
to
remember
what
everyone
says
and
does,
and
i
won;t
know
the
ending
until
i
get
there.
one
eva
smith
has
gone

but
there
are

millions
and
millions
of
eva
smiths
and
john

left
with
us,
with
their
lives,
their
hopes
and
fears,
their
suffering
and
chance
of
happiness,
all
intertwined
with
our
lives,
and
what
we
think
and
say
and
do.
we
don;t
live
alone.
we
are
members
of
one
body.
we
are
responsible
for
each
other.
and
i
tell
you
that
the
time
will
soon
come
when,
if
men
will
not
learn
that
lesson,
then
they
will
be
taught
it
in
fire
and
blood
and
anguish.
true,
the
law
isn;t

that
is
because
we
people
who
made
the
law
are
imperfect.
but
i
still
believe
the
law
can
show
the
way
to
righteousness
and
justice.
the
world;s
changing
out
there,
there
are
a
lot
of
new,
exciting
ideas
running
around.
some
may
be
right
and
some
may
be
cockeyed
but
they;re
affecting
all
our
lives.
i
want
to
know
how
i
stand,
where
i
fit
in
the
picture,
what
it;s
all
gonna
mean
to
me.

sitting
behind

in
an
office,

as
soon
as
i
get
enough
money
together,
i;m
going
to
knock
off
for
a
while.
i
know
i
should
be
angry.
i
should
be
furious.
what
a
way
to
behave
your
first
day
at
school!
but,
if
you
promise
me
that
nothing
of
the
sort
will
happen
again,
i
won;t
say
another
word
about
it.
he;s
not
asking
me
to
make
a
choice.
he;s
telling
me
to
take
a
stand.
i;m
either
with
him
or
against
him.
all
or
nothing.
i;m
disgusted
with
the
whole
business.
i
don;t
want
smicha
if
the
price
i
have
to
pay
for
it
is
to
stop
thinking.
i
hate
this
town.
it;s
too
filled
with
memories
i;d
rather
forget.
i
go
to
school
every
day,
hang
out
with
my
friends,
and
then
go
home.
there;s
no
place
i;d
rather
not
go
ever
again.
i
wonder
if
anything
will
ever
change?
will
that
day
ever
come?
contrary
to
the
feminist
cant,
there
are
many
things
we
can
learn
from
men;s
perspective
about
life
and
personal
identity.
to
refuse
to
learn
anything
that
could
prove
beneficial
to
yourself
is
a
working
definition
of
stupid.
when
i
left
my
home
and
my
family,
i
was
no
more
than
a
boy
in
the
company
of
strangers
in
the
quiet
of
the
railway
station,
running
scared,
laying
low,
seeking
out
the
poorer
quarters
where
the
ragged
people
go.
looking
for
the
places
only
they
would
know.
if
there;s
a
bustle
in
your
hedgerow,
don;t
be
alarmed
now,
it;s
just
a
spring
clean
for
the
may
queen.
yes,
there
are
two
paths
you
can
go
by,
but
in
the
long
run
there;s
still
time
to
change
the
road
you;re
on.
an
actress
should
never,
ever,
be
asked
to
run
beside
a
van
in
red
disco
boots
for
more
than
about
half
a
block,
and
then
only
if
her
child
is
being
kidnapped.
i;ve
noticed
that
about
your
people,
doctor.
you
find
it
easier
to
understand
the
death
of
one
than
the
death
of
a
million.
you
speak
about
the
objective
hardness
of
the
vulcan
heart
yet
how
little
room
there
seems
to
be
in
yours.
the
way
you
walked
was
thorny,
through
no
fault
of
your
own,
but
as
the
rain
enters
the
soil,
the
river
enters
the
sea,
so
tears
run
to
a
predestined
end.
your
suffering
is
over,
bela
my
son.
now
you
will
find
peace.
the
breath
of
the
morning,
i
keep
forgetting
the
smell
of
the
warm
summer
air.
i
live
in
a
town
where
you
can;t
smell
a
thing;
you
watch
your
feet
for
cracks
in
the
pavement.
up
above,
aliens
hover
making
home
movies
for
the
folks
back
home,
of
all
these
weird
creatures
who
lock
up
their
spirits,
drill
holes
in
themselves
and
live
for
their
secrets...
we;ll
send
him
cheesy
movies,
the
worst
we
can
find.
he;ll
have
to
sit
and
watch
them
all
and
we;ll
monitor
his
mind.
now
keep
in
mind
joel
can;t
control
when
the
movies
begin
or
end
because
he
used
those
special
parts
to
make
his
robot
friends.
i
think
you;re
the
kindest,
sweetest,
prettiest
person
i;ve
ever
met
in
my
life.
i;ve
never
seen
anyone
that;s
nicer
to
people
than
you
are.
the
first
time
i
saw
you...
something
happened
to
me.
i
never
told
you
but
i
knew
that
i
wanted
to
hold
you
as
hard
as
i
could.
i
don;t
deserve
someone
like
you.
but
if
i
ever
could,
i
swear
i
would
love
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
no
matter
what
the
world
is,
the
god
of
that
world
creates
the
rules.
in
truth,
you
have
been
defeated
by
the
rules
i
created.
and
as
punishment
for
defying
the
god
of
the
new
world,
you
will
die...
if
only
all
the
contradictory
voices
shouting
inside
my
head
would
calm
down
and
sing
a
song
in
unison,
whatever
it
was
i
wouldn;t
care
as
long
as
they
sang
without
dissonance.
"learning
how
to
think"
really
means
learning
how
to
exercise
some
control
over
how
and
what
you
think.
it
means
being
conscious
and
aware
enough
to
choose
what
you
pay
attention
to
and
to
choose
how
you
construct
meaning
from
experience.
because
if
you
cannot
or
will
not
exercise
this
kind
of
choice
in
adult
life,
you
will
be
totally
hosed.
the
world
is
indeed
full
of
peril,
and
in
it
there
are
many
dark
places;
but
still
there
is
much
that
is
fair,
and
though
in
all
lands
love
is
now
mingled
with
grief,
it
grows
perhaps
the
greater.
sometimes
a
hypocrite
is
nothing
more
than
a
man
in
the
process
of
changing.
you
know,
back
in
the
apartment,
i
suddenly
felt
like
i
didn;t
know
you
at
all.
it
was
as
if
you
were
a
stranger.
but
how
can
that
be
true?
i
so
vividly
remember
meeting
you.
i
remember
falling
in
love
with
you.
i
remember
losing
you.
when
i
was
a
child,
i
heard
voices.
some
would
sing
and
some
would
scream.
you;ll
soon
find
you
have
few
choices.
i
learned
the
voices
died
with
me.
when
i
was
a
child,
i;d
sit
for
hours,
staring
into
open
flames.
something

a
power,

barely
tear
my
eyes
away.
all
you
have
is
your
fire
and
the
place
you
need
to
reach.
don;t
you
ever
tame
your
demons,
but
always
keep
them
on
a
leash.
i
give
it
to
you
not
that
you
may
remember
time,
but
that
you
might
forget
it
now
and
then
for
a
moment
and
not
spend
all
your
breath
trying
to
conquer
it.

with
others
takes
place
when
they
understand
what
you;re
trying

get
across
to

if
they
don;t

then
you
are
not

regardless
of

or
anything
else.
people
only
understand
things
in

of
their

means
that

that
by

well,
that;s
where
you;re
right.

-
and
i
am
only
saying
this
because
i

-
there

of
what
he
told
you
to
do.
but
i
don;t
think
i
have
to
do
that,
you
see?
no,
because
you;re
so
damn
smart.
you;re
smarter
than
any
white

you;re
just
gonna
stay
here
and
show
us
all.

got
such
a
big

you
could
never
live
with
yourself

you
could
put
us

to

only
the
silent,
sleepy,
staring

in
the
backwoods
can
tell
all
that
has
lain
hidden
since
the
early
days;
and
they
are
not
communicative,
being
loath
to
shake
off
the
drowsiness
which
helps

feels
that
it

in

been
my
privilege
to
not

be
at
your

to
be
treated
like
a

for
you

never

that

those
moments
her
face

that
her

i
was
sleeping.
and
the
vision
that
was
planted
in
my
brain
still
remains,
within
the
sound
of
silence.
we
can;t
retract
the
decisions
we;ve
made.
we
can
only
affect
the
decisions
we;re
going
to
make
from
here.
the
single
most
important
thing
you
can
do
to
achieve
financial
security
is
to
begin
a
regular
savings
program
and
to
start
it
as
early
as
possible.
we
all
know
people
who
are
very
bright
but
who
do
not
always
shine
when
it
comes
to
being
logical.
they
have
the
ability
to
think
logically
-
that
is,
clearly
and
effectively
-
but
that
ability
does
not
habitually
manifest
itself.
as
much
money
and
life
as
you
could
want!
the
two
things
most
human
beings
would
choose
above
all
-
the
trouble
is,
humans
do
have
a
knack
of
choosing
precisely
those
things
that
are
worst
for
them.
i;ve
never
taken
you
for
a
killer.
a
bit
intense
and
unpredictable
at
times,
perhaps
emotionally
unstable
occasionally,
but
i
don;t
think
you;re
the
type
of
person
who
could
simply
walk
up
to
another
human
being,
put
a
gun
to
his
head,
and
pull
the
trigger.
the
poor
man
determined
to
find
another
home,
hoping
that
when
they
no
longer
met
every
day
his
enemy
would
forget
all
about
him.
i
had
an
experience.
i
can;t
prove
it,
i
can;t
even
explain
it,
but
everything
that
i
know
as
a
human
being,
everything
that
i
am
tells
me
that
it
was
real.
i
was
given
something
wonderful,
something
that
changed
me
forever.
a
vision
of
the
universe
that
tells
us
undeniably
how
tiny
and
insignificant,
and
how
rare
and
precious
we
all
are.
a
vision
that
tells
us
that
we
belong
to
something
that
is
greater
than
ourselves,
that
we
are
not
-
that
none
of
us
are
alone.
i
wish
i
could
share
that.
i
wish
that
everyone,
if
even
for
one
moment,
could
feel
that
awe
and
humility
and
hope.
but
that
continues
to
be
my
wish.
an
ochre
love
in
the
heart
of
all,
an
ochre
love
and
the
cold
sea
shores,
dear.
my
blood
is
yours
for
the
night,
;cause
my
fears
are
only
little
things
like
these
cold
seas
and
broken
strings.
cardan;s
gaze
catches
mine,
and
i
can;t
help
the
evil
smile
that
pulls
up
the
corners
of
my
mouth.
his
eyes
are
bright
as
coals,
his
hatred
a
living
thing,
shimmering
in
the
air
between
us
like
the
air
above
black
rocks
on
a
blazing
summer
day.
what
you
do
as
soon
as
you
get
up
can
underpin
and
affect
your
mood
for
the
entire
day.
therefore
it
is
important
to
approach
the
day
gently,
without
a
sense
of
worry,
tension
or
rush.
also,
you
need
to
start
off
by
making
sure
your
body
is
happy
and
comfortable,
otherwise
feel
ill
all
day.
ever
since
i
was
a
child,
folks
have
thought
they
had
me
pegged,
because
of
the
way
i
am,
the
way
i
talk.
and
they;re
always
wrong.
love
is
a
command,
not
just
a
feeling.
somehow,
in
the
romantic
world
of
music
and
theater
we
have
made
love
to
be
what
it
is
not.
we
have
so
mixed
it
with
beauty
and
charm
and
sensuality
and
contact
that
we
have
robbed
it
of
its
higher
call
of
cherishing
and
nurturing.
you,
me,
or
nobody
is
gonna
hit
as
hard
as
life.
but
it
ain;t
about
how
hard
you
hit.
it;s
about
how
hard
you
can
get
hit
and
keep
moving
forward.
that;s
how
winning
is
done!
perhaps
it
was
an
old
flame
he
was
in
mourning
for
from
the
days
beyond
recall.
she
thought
she
understood.
she
would
try
to
understand
him
because
men
were
so
different.
whoever
talks
about
what
does
not
concern
him
often
hears
what
does
not
please
him.
in
this
grave
hour,
perhaps
the
most
fateful
in
our
history,
i
send
to
every
household
of
my
peoples,
both
at
home
and
overseas,
this
message,
spoken
with
the
same
depth
of
feeling
for
each
one
of
you,
as
if
i
were
able
to
cross
your
threshold
and
speak
to
you
myself:
for
the
second
time
in
the
lives
of
most
of
us,
we
are
at
war.
i
bet
you;re
wondering
how
i
knew
about
your
plans
to
make
me
blue
with
some
other
guy
you
knew
before.
between
the
two
of
us
guys,
you
know
i
loved
you
more.
read
the
newspaper.
what
does
it
say?
all
bad.
it;s
all
bad.
people
have
forgotten
what
life
is
all
about.
they;ve
forgotten
what
it
is
to
be
alive.
they
need
to
be
reminded.
they
need
to
be
reminded
of
what
they
have
and
what
they
can
lose.
what
i
feel
is
the
joy
of
life,
the
gift
of
life,
the
freedom
of
life,
the
wonderment
of
life!
so
they;re
finally
here,
performing
for
you.
if
you
know
the
words,
you
can
join
in
too.
put
your
hands
together
if
you
want
to
clap,
as
we
take
you
through
this
monkey
rap!
when
the
snows
fall
and
the
white
winds
blow,
the
lone
wolf
dies
but
the
pack
survives.
while
there
are
few
problems
in
today;s
world
that
the
united
states
can
solve
alone,
there
are
even
fewer
that
can
be
solved
without
the
united
states.
we
all
know
that
something
is
eternal.
and
it
ain;t
houses
and
it
ain;t
names,
and
it
ain;t
earth,
and
it
ain;t
even
the
stars...
everybody
knows
in
their
bones
that
something
is
eternal,
and
that
something
has
to
do
with
human
beings.
all
the
greatest
people
ever
lived
have
been
telling
us
that
for
five
thousand
years
and
yet
you;d
be
surprised
how
people
are
always
losing
hold
of
it.
there;s
something
way
down
deep
that;s
eternal
about
every
human
being.
so
this
is
it.
you
are
scored
on
my
heart,
clark.
you
were
from
the
first
day
you
walked
in,
with
your
ridiculous
clothes
and
your
bad
jokes
and
your
complete
inability
to
ever
hide
a
single
thing
you
felt.
i
hope
some
day
you;ll
join
us
and
the
world
will
be
as
one.
imagine
no
possessions,
i
wonder
if
you
can.
no
need
for
greed
or
hunger,
a
brotherhood
of
man.
imagine
all
the
people
sharing
all
the
world.
it;s
one
thing
to
question
your
mind;
it;s
another
to
question
your
eyes
and
ears.
but
then
again,
isn;t
it
all
the
same,
our
senses
just
mediocre
inputs
for
our
brain?
sure,
we
rely
on
them,
trust
they
accurately
portray
the
real
world
around
us,
but
what
if
the
haunting
truth
is
they
can;t?
ever
since
your
brother
got
taken
down...
i;ve
had
my
eye
on
you.
because
all
that
building
resentment
was
written
over
your
face.
i
know
that
when
i
see
it.
and
i
know
just
how
much
grudges
like
that...
can
cloud
a
person;s
vision.
see,
when
you;re
a
little
kid,
nobody
ever
warns
you
that
you;ve
got
an
expiration
date.
one
day
you;re
hot
stuff
and
the
next
day
you;re
a
dirt
sandwich.
sometimes
i
wonder
why
i
spend
the
lonely
nights
dreaming
of
a
song.
the
melody
haunts
my
reverie,
and
i
am
once
again
with
you.
when
our
love
was
new,
and
each
kiss
an
inspiration.
oh,
but
that
was
long
ago,
now
my
consolation
is
in
the
stardust
of
a
song.
you
keep
using
that
word.
i
do
not
think
it
means
what
you
think
it
means.
an
eye
for
an
eye
only
ends
up
making
the
whole
world
blind.
well
i
watch
you
tangle
every
weekend.
it
might
start
different
but
it
ends
up
the
same.
one
minute
you;re
casually
speaking.
the
next
it
all
goes
up
and
you
pour
fuel
on
the
flame
with
your
jerry
can
of
words
and
tones.
you
are
too
generous
to
trifle
with
me.
if
your
feelings
are
still
what
they
were
last
april,
tell
me
so
at
once.
my
affections
and
wishes
are
unchanged;
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
me
on
this
subject
for
ever.
take
the
fifteen
minutes
before
homeroom
every
morning.
what
you
do
with
those
fifteen
minutes
says
pretty
much
everything
there
is
to
say
about
you
as
a
human
being.
when
you
type
faster
than
usual,
it
forces
you
to
start
looking
ahead
at
the
words
that
are
coming
up
so
you
can
figure
out
where
to
place
your
fingers
in
anticipation.
so,
if
you
see
that
the
next
four
letters
will
all
be
typed
with
fingers
on
your
left
hand,
you
can
move
the
correct
finger
on
your
right
hand
into
place
for
the
fifth
letter
ahead.
tests
on
the
best
typists
have
shown
that
their
speeds
are
closely
related
to
how
far
ahead
they
look
at
upcoming
letters
while
they
type.
let;s
go
in
the
garden.
you;ll
see
something
waiting,
right
there
where
you
left
it,
laying
upside
down.
when
you
finally
find
it
you;ll
see
how
it;s
faded.
the
underside
is
lighter
when
you
turn
it
around.
when
you
lose
control,
you;ll
reap
the
harvest
you
have
sown.
and
as
the
fear
grows,
the
bad
blood
slows
and
turns
to
stone.
and
it;s
too
late
to
lose
the
weight
you
used
to
need
to
throw
around.
so
have
a
good
drown,
as
you
go
down,
all
alone...
dragged
down
by
the
stone.
they
just
use
your
mind
and
they
never
give
you
credit.
it;s
enough
to
drive
you
crazy
if
you
let
it.
nine
to

service
and
devotion.
you
would
think
that
i
would
deserve
a
fat
promotion.
want
to
move
ahead
but
the
boss
won;t
seem
to
let
me.
i
swear
sometimes
that
man
is
out
to
get
me.
chaos
isn;t
a
pit.
chaos
is
a
ladder.
many
who
try
to
climb
it
fail
and
never
get
to
try
again.
the
fall
breaks
them.
and
some
are
given
a
chance
to
climb;
they
cling
to
the
realm
or
the
gods
or
love.
only
the
ladder
is
real.
the
climb
is
all
there
is.
outside
the
street;s
on
fire
in
a
real
death
waltz,
between
what;s
flesh
and
what;s
fantasy.
and
the
poets
down
here
don;t
write
nothing
at
all.
they
just
stand
back
and
let
it
all
be.
and
in
the
quick
of
a
knife,
they
reach
for
their
moment
and
try
to
make
an
honest
stand,
but
they
wind
up
wounded,
not
even
dead.
i
wish
we;ll
end
up
this
crazy
way
before
we
burn
our
steam.
i
don;t
want
to
sound
defeated,
but
if
you
still
don;t
get
it,
you;re
never
gonna
get
it.
how
could
you
be
a
friend
of
mine?
not
only
do
we
come
into
fairly
regular
contact
with
people
who
want
to
know
what
our
family
looks
like,
but
we
also
must
navigate
a
vast
array
of
organizations
and
agencies
that
have
their
own
definitions
of
family
and
may,
at
times,
impose
them
on
us.
you
can
tie
up
a
lot
of
resources
by
keeping
a
bugged
phone
line
open.
as
long
as
it;s
open,
they;re
supposed
to
keep
listening.
say
a
few
cryptic
things
now
and
then
and
they;ll
be
stuck
in
their
little
van
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
you;re
doing.
a
magician
is
strong
because
he
feels
pain.
he
feels
the
difference
between
what
the
world
is
and
what
he
would
make
of
it.
or
what
did
you
think
that
stuff
in
your
chest
was?
a
magician
is
strong
because
he
hurts
more
than
others.
his
wound
is
his
strength.
we
stand
against
the
small
tide
of
those
who
want
to
make
everyone
unhappy
with
conflicting
theory
and
thought.
moral
of
the
story
is:
i
chose
a
half
measure
when
i
should
have
gone
all
the
way.
i;ll
never
make
that
mistake
again.
no
more
half
measures,
walter.
sometimes
she
did
not
know
what
she
feared,
what
she

whether
she
feared
or
desired
what
had

or
what
would
be,
and
precisely
what
she
desired,
she
did
not
know.
it
is
no
worse
because
i
write
of
it.
it
would
be
no
better
if
i
stopped
my
most
unwilling
hand.
nothing
can
undo
it;
nothing
can
make
it
otherwise
than
as
it
was.
always
seems
to
me
you
only
see
what
people
want
you
to
see.
how
long;s
it
gonna
be
before
we
get
on
the

and
cause
no
fuss?

the
seaweed
is

you
dream
about
going
up
there,
but
that
is
a
big
mistake.
just
look
at
the
world
around
you
right
here
on
the
ocean
floor.
such
wonderful
things
surround
you.
what
more
is
you
looking
for?
i
was
selfish
to
assume
you
loved
me
more
than
you
loved
yourself
even
though
i;ve
never
felt
the
same.
there;s
a
clocktower
in
hereford,
where
the
names
of
the
dead
are
inscribed.
we
try
to
honor
their
deeds,
even
as
their
faces
fade
from
our
memory.
those
memories
are
all
that;s
left,
when
they
have
taken
everything
else.
hey
you...
did
you
ever
realize
what
you;d
become,
and
did
you
see
that
it
wasn;t
only
me
you
were
running
from?
did
you
know
all
the
time
but
it
never
bothered
you
anyway,
leading
the
blind
while
i
stared
out
the
steel
in
your
eyes?
anyway,
it;s
best
not
to
think
about
them,
as
if
you
do
it
makes
the
discussions
with
the
other
lawyers,
all
their
advice
and
all
that
they
do
manage
to
achieve,
seem
so
unpleasant
and
useless,
i
had
that
experience
myself,
just
wanted
to
throw
everything
away
and
lay
at
home
in
bed
and
hear
nothing
more
about
it.
but
that,
of
course,
would
be
the
stupidest
thing
you
could
do,
and
you
wouldn;t
be
left
in
peace
in
bed
for
very
long
either.
our
minds
are
born
festering
with
sin.
some
are
so
blighted,
they
will
never
find
redemption.
the
mind
must
not
be
pulled
from
the
roots.
my
children
are
without
blame,
without
fault
-
and
without
choice.
for
what
is
the
value
of
will
when
the
spirit
is
found
wanting?
no
more
will
my
green
sea
go
turn
a
deeper
blue.
i
could
not
foresee
this
thing
happening
to
you.
if
i
look
hard
enough
into
the
setting
sun,
my
love
will
laugh
with
me
before
the
morning
comes.
i
know
these
will
all
be
stories
someday.
and
our
pictures
will
become
old
photographs.
we;ll
all
become
somebody;s
mom
or
dad.
but
right
now
these
moments
are
not
stories.
this
is
happening.
i
am
here
and
i
am
looking
at
her.
and
she
is
so
beautiful.
i
can
see
it.
this
one
moment
when
you
know
you;re
not
a
sad
story.
you
are
alive,
and
you
stand
up
and
see
the
lights
on
the
buildings
and
everything
that
makes
you
wonder.
and
you;re
listening
to
that
song
and
that
drive
with
the
people
you
love
most
in
this
world.
and
in
this
moment
i
swear
we
are
infinite.
i
sing
the
body
electric,
the
armies
of
those
i
love
engirth
me
and
i
engirth
them,
they
will
not
let
me
off
till
i
go
with
them,
respond
to
them,
and
discorrupt
them,
and
charge
them
full
with
the
charge
of
the
soul.
they
burned
the
flag
and
they
demonstrated
against
us;
it;s
on
the
cover
of
the
paper
today.
they
have
no
respect.
they
have
no
idea
what;s
going
on

are
sacrificing
their
lives.

are
dying
every
day
over
there,
and
nobody
back
here
even
seems
to
care.
we
live
where
the
war
is
raging,
chasing
our
crazy
dreams.
i
dreamed
a
dream
in
time
gone
by,
when
hope
was
high
and
life
worth
living.
i
dreamed
that
love
would
never
die.
i
dreamed
that
god
would
be
forgiving.
then
i
was
young
and
unafraid
when
dreams
were
made
and
used
and
wasted.
there
was
no
ransom
to
be
paid,
no
song
unsung,
no
wine
untasted.
the
fear
of
death
has
disordered
my
reason
and
subjected
me
to
delusions.
and
i
became
full
of
shame
for
none
of
my
lineage
ought
to
fear
death
more
than
the
biting
of
a
gnat.
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
are
nothing
compared
to
the
fates
your
mind
can
imagine
for
your
loved
ones.
some
people
can
read
war
and
peace
and
come
away
thinking
it;s
a
simple
adventure
story.
others
can
read
the
ingredients
on
a
chewing
gum
wrapper
and
unlock
the
secrets
of
the

you

you;ve
imagined
a
possibility
for
yourself
that
you
somehow
deserve

your

dead

cut
it
loose.
don;t
focus
on
what
you
think
you
deserve.
take
aim
on
what
you
are
willing
to
earn!
i
want
you
to
say
that
you
know
what
i;m
saying.
but
i
need
more,
because
i;ll
be
you,
you;ll
be
me.

is

and
i;ll
be
electric
too.
to
dream
in
isolation
can
be
properly
splendid
to
be
sure;
but
to
dream
in
company
seems
to
me
infinitely
preferable.
round
the
world
we;ll
go,
does
anybody
know,

if
we;re
looking
out
on
the
day
of
another
dream.
if
you
can;t
get
what
you
want
then
you
come
with
me.
i;m
not
the
one
who;s
lost
with
no
direction,
but
you;ll
never
see.
you;re
so
busy
making
masks
with
my
name
on
them
in
all
caps.
you
got
the
talking
down,
just
not
the
listening.
there;s

quickly
they

that
all
it
takes
to
change
the
course
of

the

isn;t
that
something?
that
is
pretty.
i
like
these
kind
of
paintings.
and
you
know
me,
shoot,
there;s
a
minute
or
two
left
here,
let;s
have
us
a
happy
tree.
we;ll
just
take
the
knife,
maybe
we;ll
have
an
old
birch
tree
that
lives
right
here.
let;s
just
let
it
run
all
the
way
up
here.
now,
you
could
have
left
the
birch
tree
inside
of
the
oval,
but
i
sort
of
like
it
when
it
sneaks
out
a
little
bit.
but
when
you
do
your
painting,
you
make
that
decision.
if
you
want
him
to
live
inside
that
oval,
you
put
that
rascal
in
there
and
keep
him
in
there.
so
tonight,
sweet
dreams,
and
sleep
tight.
i;ve
been
trying
so
hard,
can;t
get
you
out
of
my
mind
and
if
this
is
how
it
has
to
be,
just
promise
me
you
won;t
forget
me,
and
i;ll
leave
you
with
this
lullaby,
tonight...
this
was
my
only
and
my
constant
comfort.
when
i
think
of
it,
the
picture
always
rises
in
my
mind,
of
a
summer
evening,
the
boys
at
play
in
the
churchyard,
and
i
sitting
on
my
bed,
reading
as
if
for
life.
look,
ross,
you
gotta
understand,
between
us
we
haven;t
had
a
relationship
that
has
lasted
longer
than
a
mento.
you,
however
have
had
the
love
of
a
woman
for
four
years.
four
years
of
closeness
and
sharing
at
the
end
of
which
she
ripped
your
heart
out,
and
that
is
why
we
don;t
do
it.
i
don;t
think
that
was
my
point.
don;t
take
anything
personally
-
nothing
others
do
is
because
of
you.
what
others
say
and
do
is
a
projection
of
their
own
reality,
their
own
dream.
when
you
are
immune
to
the
opinions
and
actions
of
others,
you
won;t
be
the
victim
of
needless
suffering.
it;s
really
hard
to
do
nothing
totally.
even
just
sitting
here,
like
this,
our
bodies
are
churning,
our
minds
are
chattering.
there;s
a
whole
commotion
going
on
inside
us.
it
is
always
important,
i
think,
to
be
clear
about
what
delights
you:
important,
and
more
easily
said
than
done,
to
know
exactly
what
you;d
do
if
you
didn;t
have
to
do
everything
else.
you
get
a
shiver
in
the
dark,
it;s

stop
and
you

then
i
met

he
took

please
tell

what
we;ve
learned?
i
know
it
sounds
absurd

please
tell
me
who
i
am.
i
know
you
didn;t
do
this.

i
want
you
to

is

who

be

knew
just
what
i
was
there
for,
you
heard
me
saying
a
prayer
for,

i
really
could
care
for.
and
then
there
suddenly
appeared
before
me,
the
only
one
my
arms
will
ever
hold.
i
heard
somebody
whisper
"please
adore

when
i
looked
the

had
turned
to

was
standing

alone

there
were
to

non-empty,
there

how

there

that;s
where
you;ll

without
the

your

seeing

are

looking
at

that
one

the
state
of
alabama,
whose

lips
are
presently
dripping
with
the

of

and

was

long

as

enchanted.
the
wind
puffed
out.
the
leaves
hung
silently
again
on
stiff
branches.
there
was
another
burst
of
song,
and
then
suddenly,
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path,
there
appeared
above
the
reeds
an
old
battered
hat
with
a
tall
crown
and
a
long
blue
feather
stuck
in
the
band.
night
was
a
very
different
matter.
it
was
dense,
thicker
than
the
very
walls,
and
it
was
empty,
so
black,
so
immense
that
within
it
you
could
brush
against
appalling
things
and
feel
roaming
and
prowling
around
a
strange,
mysterious
horror.
now
that
it
was
evening,
they
encamped
by
the
river
of
forgetfulness,
whose
water
no
container
can
hold.
it
is
necessary
for
all
to
drink
a
fixed
amount
of
the
water,
but
some
do
not
have
the
wisdom
to
keep
from
drinking
more
than
this
amount.
as
one
drinks
one
becomes
forgetful
of
everything.
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
they
were
asleep
there
was
thunder
and
an
earthquake,
and
then
suddenly
just
like
shooting
stars
they
were
borne
upward,
each
in
a
different
direction
to
his
birth.
some
day,
and
that
day

will
call
upon

that
day,

as
passions
are
contagious,
and
the
bulk
of
men
are
more
guided
by
the
opinions
and
pretended
opinions
of
others
than
by
their
own,
a
large
share
of
confidence,
with
a
little
share
of
argument,
will
be
apt
to
go
farther
than
all
the

the
rate
of
progress
is
so
rapid
that
what
one
learns
at
school
or
university
is
always
a
bit
out
of
date.
only
a
few
people
can
keep
up
with
the
rapidly
advancing
frontier
of
knowledge,
and
they
have
to
devote
their
whole
time
to
it
and
specialize
in
a
small
area.

rest
of
the
population
has
little
idea
of
the
advances
that
are
being
made
or
the
excitement
they
are
generating.

felt
the
urge
to
reassure
him
that
i
was
like
everybody
else,
just
like
everybody
else.
but
really
there
wasn;t
much
point,
and
i
gave
up
the
idea
out
of
laziness.
it;s
too
late
to
articulate
it,
that
empty
feeling.
you
share
the
same
fate
as
the
people
you
hate.
you
build
yourself
up
against
others;
feelings,
and
it
left
you
feeling
empty
as
a
car
coasting
downhill.
i
have
become
such
a
negative
person.
you
looked
on
amazed,
and
began
to
suspect
yourself
of
being
deaf
-
then
the
night
came
suddenly,
and
struck
you
blind
as
well.
about
three
in
the
morning
some
large
fish
leaped,
and
the
loud
splash
made
me
jump
as
though

and
if
you
were
prejudiced,
you;d
walk
around
thinking
that
you;re
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world.
but
i
can
honestly
say,
after
spending
these
marvelous
moments
with
you,
you
ain;t
better
than
anybody.
no
man;s
life
can
be
encompassed
in
one
telling.
there
is
no
way
to
give
each
year
its
allotted
weight,
to
include
each
event,
each
person
who
helped
to
shape
a
lifetime.
what
can
be
done
is
to
be
faithful
in
spirit
to
the
record
and
try
to
find
one;s
way
to
the
heart
of
the
man...
i
don;t
believe
in
an
interventionist
god,
but
i
know,
darling,
that
you
do.
but
if
i
did
i
would
kneel
down
and
ask
him
not
to
intervene
when
it
came
to
you.
not
to
touch
a
hair
on
your
head,
to
leave
you
as
you
are,
and
if
he
felt
he
had
to
direct
you,
then
direct
you
into
my
arms.
much
of
my
life
had
been
devoted
to
trying
not
to
cry
in
front
of
people
who
loved
me,
so
i
knew
what
augustus
was
doing.
you
clench
your
teeth.
you
look
up.
you
tell
yourself
that
if
they
see
you
cry,
it
will
hurt
them,
and
you
will
be
nothing
but
sadness
in
their
lives,
and
you
must
not
become
a
mere
sadness,
so
you
will
not
cry,
and
you
say
all
of
this
to
yourself
while
looking
up
at
the
ceiling,
and
then
you
swallow
even
though
your
throat
does
not
want
to
close
and
you
look
at
the
person
who
loves
you
and
smile.
it
makes
no
difference,
it
don;t
make
any
difference
to
me
what
a
man
does
for
a
living,
you
understand.
but
your
business
is
a
little
dangerous.
i
loved
jordan
catalano
so
much,
and
talked
about
him
so
much,
and
thought
about
him
so
much,
it
was
like
he
lived
inside
me.
like
he
had
taken
possession
of
my
soul,
or
something.
and
then
one
day
i
got
over
him!
let
the
darkness
lead
us
into
the
light,
let
our
dreams
get
lost

the

more
beautiful

i

into
the

and
i

in
the
infinite
lights.
baby,
tell
me
one
more
beautiful

and
i

last
night
i
dreamt
i
went
to
manderely
again.
it
seemed
to
me
i
stood
by
the
iron
gate
leading
to
the
drive,
and
for
a
while
i
could
not
enter,
for
the
way
was
barred
to
me.
there
was
a
padlock
and
a
chain
upon
the
gate.
i
called
in
my
dream
to
the
lodge-keeper,
and
had
no
answer,
and
peering
closer
through
the
rusted
spokes
of
the
gate
i
saw
that
the
lodge
was
uninhabited.
don;t
know
much
about

don;t
know
much

don;t
know
much
about
a

don;t
know
much
about
the
french
i
took.
but
i
do
know
that
i
love
you,
and
i
know
that
if
you
love
me
too,
what
a
wonderful
world
this
would
be.
i
see
in
your
eyes
the
same
fear
that
would
take
the
heart
of
me.
a
day
may
come
when
the
courage
of
men
fails,
when
we
forsake
our
friends
and
break
all
bonds
of
fellowship,
but
it
is
not
this
day.
an
hour
of
woes
and
shattered
shields,
when
the
age
of
men
comes
crashing
down!
but
it
is
not
this
day!
this
day
we
fight!
i
see
something
of
god
each
hour
of
the
twenty-four,
and
each
moment
then,
in
the
faces
of
men
and
women
i
see
god,
and
in
my
own
face
in
the
glass;
i
find
letters
from
god
dropped
in
the
street,
and
every
one
is
signed
by
god;s
name,
and
i
leave
them
where
they
are,
for
i
know
that
others
will
punctually
come
forever
and
ever.
ok
doc,
before
you
hit
the
road
you
might
wanna
grab
some
medkits,
restock
on
ammo,
maybe
check
the
map
to
see
where
you
are
headed.
there
is
an
ammo
supply
crate
on
the
back
of
the
car
if
that
is
any
comfort.
stay
with
the
car,
make
use
of
the
thumpers,
and
you
will
stand
a
fair
chance
against
the
antlions.
i
will
radio
ahead
to
let
the
next
base
know
you
are
coming.
is
it
sweeter
to
exist
only
in
the
mind
or
to
exist
both
in
the
mind
and
in
reality?
flipping
out
and
wailing
on
guitars
is
much
sweeter
when
someone
is
actually
doing
it.
so
when
we
conceive
of
the
sweetest
being
ever,
we
are
conceiving
of
the
being
that
exists
both
in
the
mind
and
in
reality.
look,
you
can;t
stop
the
years
from
passing
by.
there
comes
a
time
when
changes
have
to
be
made.
someone
younger
and
stronger
comes
along
to
fill
your
shoes
and
a
person
has
to
gracefully
step
aside.
well,
i;m
not
willing
to
do
that.
the
way
i
figure,
i;m
worth
more
on
restricted
duty
than
all
of
you
put
together
on
full
time.
good
night,
gentlemen.
from
being
used
so
much,
kneaded
with
sweat
and
sighs,
the
air
in
the
room
had
begun
to
turn
to
mud.
for
it
is
not
enough
to
have
a
good
mind;
the
main
thing
is
to
apply
it
well.
the
greatest
souls
are
capable
of
the
greatest
vices
as
well
as
the
greatest
virtues.
and
those
who
proceed
only
very
slowly
can
make
much
greater
progress,
provided
they
always
follow
the
right
path,
than
those
who
hurry
and
stray
from
it.
heaven
did
not
seem
to
be
my
home;
and
i
broke
my
heart
with
weeping
to
come
back
to
earth;
and
the
angels
were
so
angry
that
they
flung
me
out
into
the
middle
of
the
heath
on
the
top
of
wuthering
heights;
where
i
woke
sobbing
for
joy.
to
every
thing
there
is
a
season,
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven:
a
time
to
be
born,
and
a
time
to
die;
a
time
to
plant,
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
planted;
a
time
to
kill,
and
a
time
to
heal;
a
time
to
break
down,
and
a
time
to
build
up;
a
time
to
weep,
and
a
time
to
laugh;
a
time
to
mourn,
and
a
time
to
dance;
a
time
to
cast
away
stones,
and
a
time
to
gather
stones
together;
a
time
to
embrace,
and
a
time
to
refrain
from
embracing;
a
time
to
get,
and
a
time
to
lose;
a
time
to
keep,
and
a
time
to
cast
away;
a
time
to
rend,
and
a
time
to
sew;
a
time
to
keep
silence,
and
a
time
to
speak;
a
time
to
love,
and
a
time
to
hate;
a
time
of
war,
and
a
time
of
peace.
still,
we
will
let
all
this
be
a
thing
of
the
past,
though
it
hurts
us,
and
beat
down
by
constraint
the
anger
that
rises
inside
us.
now
i
am
making
an
end
of
my
anger.
it
does
not
become
me,
unrelentingly
to
rage
on.
in
and
around
the

mountains
come
out
of
the

and
they
stand
there.
one
mile
over

be
there
and
we;ll

you,
ten
true
summers
we;ll
be
there
and

four
before
my
love
you;ll
see,
i;ll
be

with

the
idea
that
he
did
not
really
have
control
over
the
coming
event
was
comforting
for
a
moment,
for
it
relieved
him
of
the
responsibility
for
making
the
decision
himself
-
at
least
for
a
time.
sometimes
it
makes
me
sad,
though...
andy
being
gone.
i
have
to
remind
myself
that
some
birds
aren;t
meant
to
be
caged.
their
feathers
are
just
too
bright.
and
when
they
fly
away,
the
part
of
you
that
knows
it
was
a
sin
to
lock
them
up
does
rejoice.
but
still,
the
place
you
live
in
is
that
much
more
drab
and
empty
that
they;re
gone.
i
guess
i
just
miss
my
friend.
i
love
bagels
even
though
they
are
one
of
mankind;s
most
dangerous
foods,
which
is
something
most
people
don;t
know.
for
instance,
there;s
actually
no
safe
way
to
slice
a
bagel.
except
maybe
you
get
somebody
to
do
it
for
you.
i
mean
you
have
no
idea
how
many
people
have
sliced
an
index
finger
in
half
along
with
a
bagel.
you
are
amoral,
are
you
not?
you
are
feeding
off
the
violence
and
the
despair
of
the
drug
trade.
you;re
stealing
from
those
who
themselves
are
stealing
the
lifeblood
from
our
city.
it;s
enough
for
me
to
be
sure
that
you
and
i
exist
at
this
moment.
wherever
they
might
be
they
always
remember
that
the
past
was
a
lie,
that
memory
has
no
return,
that
every
spring
gone
by
could
never
be
recovered,
and
that
the
wildest
and
most
tenacious
love
was
an
ephemeral
truth
in
the
end.
we
spent
as
much
money
as
we
could,
and
got
as
little
for
it
as
people
could
make
up
their
minds
to
give
us.
we
were
always
more
or
less
miserable,
and
most
of
our
acquaintance
were
in
the
same
condition.
there
was
a
gay
fiction
among
us
that
we
were
constantly
enjoying
ourselves,
and
a
skeleton
truth
that
we
never
did.
to
the
best
of
my
belief,
our
case
was
in
the
last
aspect
a
rather
common
one.
a
question
in
your
nerves
is
lit,
yet
you
know
there
is
no
answer
fit
to
satisfy,
ensure
you
not
to
quit.
to
keep
it
in
your
mind
and
not
forget
that
it
is
not
he
or
she
or
them
or
it
that
you
belong
to.
it;s
close
to
midnight,
something
evil;s
lurking
in
the
dark.
under
the
moonlight
you
see
a
sight
that
almost
stops
your
heart.
you
try
to
scream,
but
terror
takes
the
sound
before
you
make
it.
you
start
to
freeze
as
horror
looks
you
right
between
the
eyes,
you;re
paralyzed.
our
customers
are
nervous
about
financial
decisions
because
money
is
a
massive
stressor,
so
let;s
use
reassuring
words
in
our
inline
help
hints,
as
well
as
live
previews
and
confirmation
patterns
to
improve
their
confidence.
there
was
something
in
her,
something
that
was...
pure
horror.
everything
you
were
supposed
to
watch
out
for.

fire,
shards
of

everything
that
his
mom
tried
so
hard
to
keep
him
safe
from.
i
never
realized
till
now
how
ugly
i
am,
because
you;re
so
beautiful.
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
it;s
a
minute
away
from
snowing
and
there;s
this
electricity
in
the
air,
you
can
almost
hear
it.
and
this
bag
was,
like,
dancing
with
me.
like
a
little
kid
begging
me
to
play
with
it.

fifteen
minutes.
and
that;s
the
day
i
knew
there
was
this
entire
life
behind
things,
and
this
incredibly
benevolent
force.
and
his
dad;s
smile
faded
just
a
bit
-
the
prodigy

read,
but
he
could
not

and
if
only
colin
had
known
that
he
was
missing
a
piece,
that
his
inability
to
see
himself
in
the
story
of
a
circle
was
an
unfixable
problem,
he
might
have
known
that
the
rest
of
the
world
would
catch
up
with
him
as
time
passed.
i;m
in
deep
with
this
girl

she;s

all

to

i
let
it
fall,
my
heart,
and
as
it
fell
you
rose
to
claim
it.
it
was
dark
and
i
was
over
until
you
kissed
my
lips
and
you
saved
me.
my
hands,
they;re
strong,
but
my
knees
were
far
too
weak

stand
in
your
arms
without
falling
to
your
feet.

came
to
my
house
years
ago,
i
let
him
in.
maybe
that;s
a
problem,
;cause
i;ve
been
dealing
with
it
ever
since.
i
thought
that
it
would
leave,
but
it;s
obvious,
it
never
did.
it
must
have
picked
a
room
and
got
comfortable
and
settled
in.

i;m
in
the
position,
it;s
either
sit
here
and
let
him
win
or
put
it
back
outside

it
came
from,
but
i
never
can.
;cause
in
order
to
do
that
i
would
have
to
open
the
doors.
is
that
me
or
the
fear
talking?
i
don;t
know
anymore.

it
became
difficult
to
follow
the
path,
and
they
were
very
tired.
their
legs
seemed
leaden.
strange
furtive
noises
ran
among
the
bushes
and
reeds
on
either
side
of
them;
and
if
they
looked
up
to
the
pale
sky,
they
caught
sight
of
queer
gnarled
and
knobbly
faces
that
gloomed
dark
against
the
twilight,
and
leered
down
at
them
from
the
high
bank
and
the
edges
of
the
wood.
it
is
only
in
the
mysterious
equations
of
love...
that
any
logical
reasons
can
be
found.
i;m
only
here
tonight
because
of
you.
you
are
the
reason
i
am.
you
are
all
my
reasons.
thank
you.
i
think
you;re
gonna
find

when
all
this
stuff
is
over
and
done
-
i
think
you;re
gonna
find
yourself
one
smiling
guy.
thing
is
butch,
right
now
you
got
ability.
but
painful
as
it
may
be,
ability
don;t
last.
now
that;s
a
hard
fact
of
life,
but
it;s
a
fact
of
life
you;re
gonna
have
to
get
realistic
about.
life
can
get
pretty
crazy
at
times.
it
can
be
hectic,
confusing,
stressful,
and
that;s
on
a
good
day.
life
can
be
full
of
happiness
and
full
of
sadness.
one
moment
you;re
on
top
of
the
world
and
nothing
can
go
wrong.
the
next,
it
feels
as
if
nothing
will
ever
be
right
again.
i
guess
it
depends
where
you
are
right
now
on
your
ride
through
life
whether
you
smile
when
you
read
this
or
fight
back
tears.
i
never
got
to
bat
in
the
major
leagues.
i;d
have
liked
to
have
had
that
chance
just
once,
to
stare
down
a
big
league
pitcher.
to
stare
him
down,
then
just
as
he
goes
into
his
windup,
wink.
make
him
think
you
know
something
he
doesn;t.
that;s
what
i
wish
for.
the
passage
of
time
in
prisons
is
not
in
a
cell
of
brick
and
mortar
but
in
one
of
hopes
dashed
and
tragedies
unaverted.
how
precious,
then,
the
chance
to
go
back
only
to
discover
that
in
facing
the
past
you
must
face
up
to
yourself,
that
exiting
the
prison
of
time
doesn;t
free
you
from
the
prison
of
your
own
character,
one
from
which
there
is
no
escape.
nothing
is
so
painful
to
the
human
mind
as
a
great
and
sudden
change.
that
fear
had
been
inside
him
for
many
years,
it
had
lived
with
him,
it
had
been
another
shadow
ever
since
the
night
he
awoke,
shaken
by
a
bad
dream,
and
realized
that
death
was
not
only
a
permanent
probability,
as
he
has
always
believed,
but
an
immediate
reality.
wish
i
could
say
the
same,
but
i
must
say,
with
all
due
respect
i
find
it
hard
to
see
the
logic
behind
some
of
the
moves
you
have
made
with
this
fine
organization.
in
the
past
20
years,
you
have
caused
myself
and
the
city
of
new
york
a
good
deal
of
distress,
as
we
have
watched
you
take
our
beloved
yankees
and
reduce
them
to
a
laughingstock,
all
for
the
glorification
of
your
massive
ego.
the
rich
had
been
assured
of
his
wealth
and
comfort,
the
toiler
assured
of
his
life
and
work.
no
doubt
in
that
perfect
world
there
had
been
no
unemployed
problem,
no
social
question
left
unsolved.
it;s
easy
to
complain
about
your
life
-
how
tough
it
is,
how
unfair
it
is,
how
stressful
it
is,
how
everyone
else
has
it
much
better.
but
if
you
step
into
the
life
of
someone
you
envy
for
just
a
day,
you;ll
discover
that
everyone
has
their
own
problems,
and
they;re
usually
worse
than
yours.
because
your
problems
are
designed
specifically
for
you,
with
the
specific
purpose
of
helping
you
grow.
i
began
to
realize
how
important
it
was
to
be
an
enthusiast
in
life.
if
you
are
interested
in
something,
no
matter
what
it
is,
go
at
it
full
speed.
embrace
it
with
both
arms,
hug
it,
love
it
and
above
all
become
passionate
about
it.
lukewarm
is
no
good.
if
you
feel
yourself
hitting
up
against
your
limit
remember
for
what
cause
you
clench
your
fists...
remember
why
you
started
down
this
path,
and
let
that
memory
carry
you
beyond
your
limit.
anything
which
has
ended
is
finished.
that
which
is
perfect
is
finished.
the
perfect
man
is
no
exception
to
the
rule.
the
perfect
man
of
the
past
is
made
according
to
the
rule
of
the
past.
the
rule
of
the
past
is
a
law
of
injustice
and
hypocrisy.
the
revelation
of
the
meaning
of
the
law
is
revealed
through
the
law
itself.
images
of
broken
light
which
dance
before
me
like
a
million
eyes
-
they
call
me
on
and
on
across
the
universe.
thoughts
meander
like
a
restless
wind
inside
a
letter
box
-
they
tumble
blindly
as
they
make
their
way
across
the
universe.
we
are
going
to
die,
and
that
makes
us
the
lucky
ones.
most
people
are
never
going
to
die
because
they
are
never
going
to
be
born.
the
potential
people
who
could
have
been
here
in
my
place
but
who
will
in
fact
never
see
the
light
of
day
outnumber
the
sand
grains
of
arabia.
certainly
those
unborn
ghosts
include
greater
poets
than
keats,
scientists
greater
than

power
don;t
come
from
a
badge
or
a
gun.
power
comes
from
lying.
lying
big,
and
gettin;
the
whole
damn
world
to
play
along
with
you.
once
you
got
everybody
agreeing
with
what
they
know
in
their
hearts
ain;t
true,
you;ve
got
;em
by
the
balls.
recalling
the
past
dredges
up
regrets
that
make
me
want
to
die,
and
when
i
think
of
the
future,
the
anxiety
just
makes
me
depressed.
by
process
of
elimination,
you
could
say
right
now
is
my
happiest
time.
how
thick
do
you
have
to
be
to
believe
what
a
digital,
pretend
woman
on
the
dashboard
says,
over
what
you
can
actually
see
out
of
the
window.
i
mean,
the
sea,
for
example:
it;s
big,
it;s
blue,
the
top
of
it
wobbles
around
and
it;s
not
suitable
for
motor
vehicles.
but
you
know
that
already.
you
don;t
drive
into
it!
we
are
the
world,
we
are
the
children.
we
are
the
ones
who
make
a
brighter
day,
so
let;s
start
giving.
there;s
a
choice
we;re
making.
we;re
saving
our
own
lives.
it;s
true
we;ll
make
a
better
day,
just
you
and
me.
the
rest
of
my
attention
is
back
at
the
offices
of
facebook,
where
my
colleagues
and
i
are
doing
things
that
no
one
in
this
room,
including
and
especially
your
clients,
are
intellectually
or
creatively
capable
of
doing.
but
there
is
something
that
i
must
say
to
my
people
who
stand
on
the
warm
threshold
which
leads
into
the
palace
of
justice.
in
the
process
of
gaining
our
rightful
place
we
must
not
be
guilty
of
wrongful
deeds.
let
us
not
seek
to
satisfy
our
thirst
for
freedom
by
drinking
from
the
cup
of
bitterness
and
hatred.
you
do
not
understand
even
life.
how
can
you
understand
death?
sometimes,
when
you
meet
a
new
operative,
it;s
a
good
idea
to
open
with
an
aggressive
move.
you
learn
about
people
when
you
make
them
play
defense:
their
reflexes,
weaknesses,
how
they
handle
themselves
under
pressure.
and
even
if
they
are
able
to
counter,
it
never
hurts
to
know
how
far
they;re
willing
to
go.
it;s
not
a
game
if
you;re
not
having
fun.
it
doesn;t
mean
anything
if
you
just
focus
on
winning
or
losing.
sometimes,
when
you;re
writing
a
poem
-
or
a
story
-
your
brain
gets
fixated
on
a
specific
point.
if
you
try
so
hard
to
make
it
perfect,
then
you;ll
never
make
any
progress.
just
force
yourself
to
get
something
down
on
the
paper,
and
tidy
it
up
later!
another
way
to
think
about
it
is
this:
if
you
keep
your
pen
in
the
same
spot
for
too
long,
you;ll
just
get
a
big
dark
puddle
of
ink.
so
just
move
your
hand,
and
go
with
the
flow!
many
rivers
to
cross
but
i
can;t
seem
to
find
my
way
over.
wandering,
i
am
lost
as
i
travel
along
the
white
cliffs
of
dover.
many
rivers
to
cross
and
it;s
only
my
will
that
keeps
me
alive.
i;ve
been
licked,
washed
up
for
years,
and
i
merely
survive
because
of
my
pride.
it
is
not
difficult
to
wield
a
sword
in
one
hand;
the
way
to
learn
this
is
to
train
with
two
long
swords,
one
in
each
hand.
it
will
seem
difficult
at
first,
but
everything
is
difficult
at
first.
it
wasn;t
something
that
i
thought
about,
but
i
knew
that
you
were
absolute
in
doubt.
i
just
really
wanna
talk
to
you
again,
that;s
how
i
know
that
i;ma
haunt
you
in
the
end.
it
wasn;t
something
;til
you
brought
it
up,
i
knew
that
you
were
tryna
make
it
out.
without
a
single
scar,
clawing
at
my
arm,
i
saw
you
in
his
car,
swear
i
knew
it
from
the
start.
you
have
brains
in
your
head.
you
have
feet
in
your
shoes.
you
can
steer
yourself
any
direction
you
choose.
you;re
on
your
own.
and
you
know
what
you
know.
and
you
are
the
one
who;ll
decide
where
to
go.
if
you
want
to
leave,
take
good
care.
hope
you
have
a
lot
of
nice
things
to
wear,
but
then
a
lot
of
nice
things
turn
bad
out
there.
so
you
think
you
can
stone
me
and
spit
in
my
eye?
so
you
think
you
can
love
me
and
leave
me
to
die?
oh,
baby,
can;t
do
this
to
me,
baby!
just
gotta
get
out,
just
gotta
get
right
outta
here!
nothing
really
matters,
anyone
can
see.
nothing
really
matters.
nothing
really
matters
to
me,
any
way
the
wind
blows.
you
crushed
us
to
build
your
monarchy
on
the
backs
of
our
blood
and
bone.
your
mistake
wasn;t
keeping
us
alive.
it
was
thinking
we;d
never
fight
back!
i
deserve
it
all.
let
the
cold
world
do
its
worst;
one
thing
i
know
-
there;s
a
grave
somewhere
for
me.
the
world
may
go
on
just
as
it;s
always
done,
and
take
everything
from
me
-
loved
ones,
property,
everything
-
but
it
can;t
take
that.
some
day
i;ll
lie
down
in
it
and
forget
it
all,
and
my
poor
broken
heart
will
be
at
rest.
never
before
had
i
known
the
sudden
quiver
of
understanding
that
travels
from
word
to
brain
to
heart,
the
way
a
new
language
can
move,
coil,
swim
into
life
under
the
eyes,
the
almost
savage
leap
of
comprehension,
the
instantaneous,
joyful
release
of
meaning,
the
way
the
words
shed
their
printed
bodies
in
a
flash
of
heat
and
light.
just
about
any
way
you
can
paint
a
tree,
seems
like
somewhere
there;s
one
that
looks
just
about
like
that.
that;s
the
nice
thing
about
doing
landscapes.
if
you
paint
a
portrait
of
somebody
and
you
put
the
eyes
in
the
wrong
place,
chances
are
they;re
gonna
notice.
but
if
you
paint
a
tree
wrong,
somebody
will
come
along
and
say,
"hey,
i
know
that
tree.
he;s
an
old
friend.
he
lives
in
my
front
yard,
has
for
many
years."
so
you
can;t
hardly
do
him
wrong.
if
i
had
a
world
of
my
own,
everything
would
be
nonsense.
nothing
would
be
what
it
is
because
everything
would
be
what
it
isn;t.
and
contrary-wise;
what
it
is
it
wouldn;t
be,
and
what
it
wouldn;t
be,
it
would.
you
see?
this
is
your
last
chance.
after
this
there
is
no
turning
back.
you
take
the
blue
pill:
the
story
ends,
you
wake
up
in
your
bed
and
believe
whatever
you
want
to
believe.
you
take
the
red
pill:
you
stay
in
wonderland,
and
i
show
you
how
deep
the
rabbit
hole
goes.
remember,
all
i;m
offering
is
the
truth,
nothing
more.
she,
who
always
seems
so
happy
in
a
crowd,
whose
eyes
can
be
so
private
and
so
proud.
no
one;s
allowed
to
see
them
when
they
cry.
she
may
be
the
love
that
cannot
hope
to
last.
may
come
to
me
from
shadows
of
the
past
that
i;ll
remember
till
the
day
i
die.
many
folk
like
to
know
beforehand
what
is
to
be
set
on
the
table;
but
those
who
have
laboured
to
prepare
the
feast
like
to
keep
their
secret;
for
wonder
makes
the
words
of
praise
louder.
hey
you,
out
there
in
the
cold,
getting
lonely,
getting
old,
can
you
feel
me?
hey
you,
standing
in
the
aisles
with
itchy
feet
and
fading
smiles,
can
you
feel
me?
hey
you,
don;t
help
them
to
bury
the
light.
don;t
give
in
without
a
fight.
have
you
seen
the
old
man
in
the
closed
down
market,
picking
up
the
papers
with
his
worn
out
shoes?
in
his
eyes
you
see
no
pride
and
hanging
loosely
at
his
side
yesterday;s
paper,
telling
yesterday;s
news.
as
he
watches
through
the
door,
his
smile
pulls
in
more
and
more.
wicked
thoughts
shape
wicked
ways,
while
we
all
crave,
while
we
all
crave.
when
the
man
yells
at
his
son,
when
he
finds
the
smoking
gun.
don;t
you
worry,
little
one,
for
we
all
crave,
we
all
crave.
that
night
they
heard
no
noises.
but
either
in
his
dreams
or
out
of
them,
he
could
not
tell
which,
frodo
heard
a
sweet
singing
running
in
his
mind:
a
song
that
seemed
to
come
like
a
pale
light
behind
a
grey
rain-curtain,
and
growing
stronger
to
turn
the
veil
all
to
glass
and
silver,
until
at
last
it
was
rolled
back,
and
a
far
green
country
opened
before
him
under
a
swift
sunrise.
do
you
know,
this
morning,
i
was
on
a
train
that
went
through
a
city
that
wouldn;t
exist
if
it
wasn;t
for
you.
i
bought
a
ticket
from
a
man
who
would
likely
be
dead
if
it
wasn;t
for
you.
i
read
up
on
my
work,
a
whole
field
of
scientific
inquiry
that
only
exists
because
of
you.
now,
if
you
wish
you
could
have
been
normal,
i
can
promise
you,
i
do
not.
the
world
is
an
infinitely
better
place
precisely
because
you
weren;t.
do
you...
do
you
really
think
that?
i
think
that
sometimes
it
is
the
people
who
no
one
imagines
anything
of
who
do
the
things
that
no
one
can
imagine.
it
was
one
of
those
rare
and
beautiful
days
in
winter
when
england
remembers
that
there
is
a
sun.
the
star
of
the
day,
pale
but
nevertheless
still
splendid,
was
setting
in
the
horizon,
glorifying
at
one
the
heavens
and
the
sea
with
bands
of
fire,
and
casting
upon
the
tower
and
the
old
houses
of
the
city
a
last
ray
of
gold
which
made
the
windows
sparkle
like
the
reflection
of
a
conflagration.
beautiful
means
;full
of
beauty.;
beautiful
is
not
about
how
you
look
on
the
outside,
beautiful
is
about
what
you;re
made
of.
beautiful
people
spend
time
discovering
what
their
idea
of
beauty
on
this
earth
is.
they
know
themselves
well
enough
to
know
what
they
love,
and
they
love
themselves
enough
to
fill
up
with
a
little
of
their
particular
kind
of
beauty
each
day.
every
time
it
rains,
it
rains

what
is
it
about

why
do
we
feel
the
need
to
own
what
we
love
and
why
do
we
become
such
jerks
when
we
do?
we;ve
all
been
there,
you
know:
we
want
something;
we
own
it;
and
by
owning
it
we
change
it.
when
you
finally
win

thing
you
do
is
try
to
change
her.
that
little
thing
she
does
with
her
hair,
the
way
she
wears
her
clothes,
the
way
she
chews
her
gum.
until
eventually,
what
you
like,
what
you
don;t
like,
and
what
you
change
all
merges
into
one.

what
was
the
power
that
turned
the
worm
into
a
moth?
it
was
greater
than
any
power
the
builders
had
had,
he
was
sure
of
that.
the
power
that
ran
the
city
of
ember
was
feeble
by
comparison.
you
will
become
way
less
concerned
with
what
other
people
think
of
you
when
you
realize
how
seldom
they
do.
but
what
many
people
who
have
never
formed
a
corporation
don;t
know
is
that
a
corporation
is
not
really
a
thing.
a
corporation
is
merely
a
file
folder
with
some
legal
documents
in
it,
sitting
in
some
attorney;s
office
and
registered
with
a
state
government
agency.
it;s
not
a
big
building
or
a
factory
or
a
group
of
people.
eating,
bathing,
having
a
girlfriend,
having
an
active
social
life
is
incidental,
it
gets
in
the
way
of
code
time.
writing
code
is
the
primary
force
that
drives
our
lives
so
anything
that
interrupts
that
is
wasteful.
here
he
was
writing
a
formula
the
accuracy
of
which
was
certain,
but
whose
origin
in
his
brain
and
way
of
discovery
he
did
not
explain
and
we
could
not
guess.
here
is
the
average
person;s
daily
attention
training:
they
wake
up
in
the
morning,
usually
to
some
loud
song
or
blaring
alarm.
they
check
their
cell
phone
for
any
messages,
just
to
see
if
anyone
missed
them.
then
they
jump
out
of
bed
into
the
shower
and
there
they
think
about
the
110
things
that
they
have
to
do
that
day.
unfortunately,
they
haven;t
allowed
themselves
enough
time
to
get
ready
and
can
only
manage
a
small,
unhealthy
breakfast,
filling
up
instead
with
coffee.
they
get
in
their
car,
put
on
the
radio,
make
phone
calls,
and
maybe
even
try
to
text
while
driving.
they
get
angry
and
worked
up
about
the
traffic,
which
won;t
change,
although
they
think
it
should.
most
of
us
think
like
this.
we
can;t
define
consciousness
because
consciousness
does
not
exist.
humans
fancy
that
there;s
something
special
about
the
way
we
perceive
the
world,
and
yet
we
live
in
loops
as
tight
and
as
closed
as
the
hosts
do,
seldom
questioning
our
choices,
content,
for
the
most
part,
to
be
told
what
to
do
next.
the
one
place
where
a
man
ought
to
get
a
square
deal
is
in
a
courtroom,
be
he
any
color
of
the
rainbow,
but
people
have
a
way
of
carrying
their
resentments
right
into
a
jury
box.
as
you
grow
older,
you;ll
see
white
men
cheat
black
men
every
day
of
your
life,
but
let
me
tell
you
something
and
don;t
you
forget
it
-
whenever
a
white
man
does
that
to
a
black
man,
no
matter
who
he
is,
how
rich
he
is,
or
how
fine
a
family
he
comes
from,
that
white
man
is
trash.
the
evolution
of
language
marked
a
great
leap
forward
for
our
species.
it
boosted
our
cognitive
abilities
by
webbing
us
together
into
larger,
more
powerful
group
minds.
i
believe
that
another
quantum
step
in
human
cognition
awaits
us
on
the
other
side
of
direct
linkage
of
our
brains
and
minds
to
one
another.
see
the
stone
set
in
your
eyes,
see
the
thorn
twist
in
your
side.
i
wait
for
you.
sleight
of
hand
and
twist
of
fate.
on
a
bed
of
nails

makes
me
wait.
and
i
wait
without
you.
sometimes
he
awoke
with
a
feeling
of
fragments
afloat
in
his
sleep,
but
he
couldn;t
seem
to
grasp
them
and
put
them
together
into
something
worthy
of
telling
at
the
ritual.
so
i
want
you
to
get
up
now.
i
want
all
of
you
to
get
up
out
of
your
chairs.
i
want
you
to
get
up
right
now
and
go
to
the
window.
open
it
and
stick
your
head
out
and
yell,
"i;m
as
mad
as
hell
and
i;m
not
going
to
take
this
anymore!"
oh,
my
life
is
changing
every
day
in
every
possible
way.
we;re
living
on
borrowed
time
here.
every
minute
of
our
life
is
a
minute
we
steal
from
them!
you
see
them
out
there.
you
know
that
when
we
die,
we
become
them.
you
think
we
hide
behind
walls
to
protect
us
from
the
walking
dead.
don;t
you
get
it?
we
are
the
walking
dead.
looking
back
i
know
of
one
opportunity
where
an
engineer
came
to
me
with
an
idea
for
a
computer
that
would
be
used
in
the
home.
of
course
it
wasn;t
yet
called
a
personal
computer.
and
while
he
felt
very
strongly
about
it,
the
only
example
of
what
it
was
good
for
that
he
could
come
up
with
was
the
housewife
could
keep
her
recipes
on
it.
and
i
couldn;t
imagine
my
wife
with
her
recipes
on
a
computer
in
the
kitchen.
it
just
didn;t
seem
like
it
had
any
practical
application
at
all,
so
intel
didn;t
pursue
that
idea.
over
the
field
rang
his
clear
voice
calling:
"death!
ride,
ride
to
ruin
and
the
world;s
ending!"
come,
sweetheart
mine,
don;t
sit
and
pine.
tell
me
of
the
cares
that
make
you
feel
so
blue.
what
have
i
done,
answer
me,
hon.
have
i
ever
said
an
unkind
word
to
you?
my
love
is
true,
and
just
for
you,
i;d
do
almost
anything
at
any
time.
dear,
when
you
sigh,
or
when
you
cry,
something
seems
to
grip
this
very
heart
of
mine.
they
linked
their
arms
to
make
a
step,
then
boosted
me
onto
the
throne.
i
felt
like
a
baby
with
my
feet
so
high
off
the
ground.
i
looked
around
at
the
other
gloomy,
empty
thrones,
and
i
could
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
sitting
on
the
olympian
council
-
so
much
power
but
so
much
arguing,
always
eleven
other
gods
trying
to
get
their
way.
it
would
be
easy
to
get
paranoid,
to
look
out
only
for
my
own
interest,
especially
if
i
were
poseidon.
sitting
in
his
throne,
i
felt
like
i
had
the
entire
sea
at
my
command
-
vast
cubic
miles
of
ocean
churning
with
power
and
mystery.
why
should
poseidon
listen
to
anyone?
why
shouldn;t
he
be
the
greatest
of
the
twelve?
you
gave
me
love
and
helped
me
find
the
sun,
and
every
time
that
i
was
down
you
would
always
come
around
and
get
my
feet
back
on
the
ground.
you
see
i
used
to
shoot
game
for
them.
well,
he
wanted
it,
and
wouldn;t
hear
reason.
he
declared
he
would
shoot
me
unless
i
gave
him
the
ivory
and
then
cleared
out
of
the
country,
because
he
could
do
so,
and
had
a
fancy
for
it,
and
there
was
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
him
killing
whom
he
jolly
well
pleased.
and
it
was
true,
too.
i
gave
him
the
ivory.
i
took
her
hand
in
mine,
and
we
went
out
of
the
ruined
place;
and
as
the
morning
mists
had
risen
long
ago
when
i
first
left
the
forge,
so
the
evening
mists
were
rising
now,
and
in
all
the
broad
expanse
of
tranquil
light
they
showed
to
me,
i
saw
no
shadow
of
another
parting
from
her.
i
don;t
know
what
is
going
to
happen
next
year,
no
one
does.
but
that;s
ok.
i
can
handle
it,
i
decide.
it;s
just
a
harder
gear,
and
i
am
ready.
all
i
have
to
do
is
take
a
deep
breath
and
ride.
me
and
you,
we
got
more
yesterday
than
anybody.
we
need
some
kind
of
tomorrow.
people
changed
slowly,
over
time.
you
didn;t
take
one
step,
then
find
yourself
in
a
completely
new
location.
you
first
took
a
little
step
off
a
path
to
avoid
some
rocks.
for
a
while,
you
walked
alongside
the
path,
but
then
you
wandered
out
a
little
way
to
step
on
softer
soil.
then
you
stopped
paying
attention
as
you
drifted
farther
and
farther
away.
finally,
you
found
yourself
in
the
wrong
city,
wondering
why
the
signs
on
the
roadway
hadn;t
led
you
better.
darling,
i
am
growing
old,
silver
threads
among
the
gold.
shine
upon
my
brow
today,
life
is
fading
fast
away.
but,
my
darling,
you
will
be
always
young
and
fair
to
me.
yes,
my
darling,
you
will
be
always
young
and
fair
to
me.
she
did
not
know
what
this
chance
would
be,
what
wind
would
bring
it
her,
towards
what
shore
it
would
drive
her.
and
yeah,
i
believe
that
there;s
a
god.
i
believe
that
there
is
something
out
there
other
than
my
thoughts.
i
believe
it
was
never
science
against
religion;
it
wasn;t
poor
against
wealth;
it
was
always
me
against
myself,
and
i;m
so
scared
who;s
going
to
win.
when
you
go
into
the
er,
one
of
the
first
things
they
ask
you
to
do
is
rate
your
pain
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten,
and
from
there
they
decide
which
drugs
to
use
and
how
quickly
to
use
them.
i;d
been
asked
this
question
hundreds
of
times
over
the
years,
and
i
remember
once
early
on
when
i
couldn;t
get
my
breath
and
it
felt
like
my
chest
was
on
fire,
flames
licking
the
inside
of
my
ribs
fighting
for
a
way
to
burn
out
of
my
body,
my
parents
took
me
to
the
er.
nurse
asked
me
about
the
pain,
and
i
couldn;t
even
speak,
so
i
held
up
nine
fingers.
why;d
you
come,
you
knew
you
should
have
stayed.
i
tried
to
warn
you
just
to
stay
away.
and
now
they;re
outside
ready
to
bust.
it
looks
like
you
might
be
one
of
us.
one
day
beneath
the
lemon
tree,
my
love
and
i
did
lie.
a
girl
so
sweet
that
when
she
smiled
the
stars
rose
in
the
sky.
we
passed
that
summer
lost
in
love
beneath
the
lemon
tree.
the
music
of
her
laughter
hid
my
father;s
words
from
me.
the
difference
between
treason
and
patriotism
is
only
a
matter
of
dates.
gaston
was
not
only
a
fierce
lover,
with
endless
wisdom
and
imagination,
but
he
was
also,
perhaps,
the
first
man
in
the
history
of
the
species
who
had
made
an
emergency
landing
and
had
come
close
to
killing
himself
and
his
sweetheart
simply
to
make
love
in
a
field
of
violets.
oh,
you;re
leaving...
i
always
knew
that
one
day,
this
day
would
come.
i;ve
always
known
we;re
so
different,
and
i;m
not
sad,
because
you
have
a

ahead
of

to

all
i

was
act

give
you

there;s

by

i

you
don;t

i

during
my
meditation
training,
i
came
to
a
place
of
deep
silence.
i
was
surrounded
by
light.
time
and
space
disappeared.
i
had
come
to
a
place
my
master
had
never
told
me
about.
he
may
look
like
an
idiot
and
talk
like
an
idiot,
but
don;t

that
fool

he
really
is
an

if
you
want
to
stay
alive,
you
have
to
say
that
stuff,

my

much,
we
live
a
thousand
miles
away
and
never
stay
in

any
finite
number
divided
by
infinity
is
as
near
to
nothing
as
makes
no
odds,
so
the
average
population
of
all
the
planets
in
the
universe
can
be
said
to
be
zero.
from
this
it
follows
that
the
population
of
the
whole
universe
is
also
zero,
and
that
any
people
you
may
meet
from
time
to
time
are
merely
the
products
of
a
deranged
imagination.
i
won;t
say
another
word
-
not
one.
i
know
i
talk
too
much,
but
i
am
really
trying
to
overcome
it,
and
although
i
say
far
too
much,
yet
if
you
only
knew
how
many
things
i
want
to
say
and
don;t,
you;d
give
me
some
credit
for
it.
it
was
a
strange
feeling,
holding
the
rifle.
it
somehow
removed
him
from
everything
around
him.
without
the
rifle
he
had
to
fit
in,
to
be
part
of
it
all,
to
understand
it
and
use
it
-
the
woods,
all
of
it.
with
the
rifle,
suddenly,
he
didn;t
have
to
know,
did
not
have
to
be
afraid
or
understand.
he
didn;t
have
to
get
close
to
a
foolbird
to
kill
it
-
didn;t
have
to
know
how
it
would
stand
if
he
didn;t
look
at
it
and
moved
off
to
the
side.
nothing
in
life
is
easy.
but
that;s
no
reason
to
give
up.
you;ll
be
surprised
what
you
can
accomplish
if
you
set
your
mind
to
it.
earlier
tonight
i
went
out.
i
went
out
hard.
i
drank
a
lot
of
whiskey.
i
wish
i
could
say
i
didn;t
enjoy
it,
that
i
felt
sick
to
my
stomach,
couldn;t
even
look
at
myself
in
the
mirror
afterward,
but
i
can;t
say
that
because
it
was
perfect.
and
that
kind
of
perfection
doesn;t
make
me
feel
weak;
it
makes
me
feel
strong.
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
mirror
and
i
finally
recognized
that
person
i
once
knew
so
well
-
that
person
who
went
out
all
the
time,
sometimes
just
for
fun.
and
now
that
i;ve
seen
that
person
again,
i
don;t
know
if
i
could
ever
go
back.
you
think
the
dead
we
loved
ever
truly
leave
us?
you
think
that
we
don;t
recall
them
more
clearly
than
ever
in
times
of
great
trouble?
your
father
is
alive
in
you,
harry,
and
shows
himself
plainly
when
you
have
need
of
him.
you
make
me
sick.
you;re
a
quitter,
norman!
no,
you;re
worse
than
that,
you;re
a
non-starter.
you
don;t
even
try.
you
sit
around
the
bar
all
day,
you
sit
around
your
house
all
day,
you
sit
around
here
all
day,
you
sit
around
life
all
day!
how
are
you
going
to
feel
at
the
end
of
your
life
when
you;re
lying
-
no,
make
that
sitting,
on
your
death
bed
and
you
realize
the
only
thing
you;ve
done
in
your
life
was
sit
around,
and
watch
people
do
things,
make
things
out
of
their
lives?
well,
maybe
you;re
right,
norman.
maybe
you;re
not
meant
for
success,
maybe
you;re
meant
for
exactly
what
you
are
-
nothing.
a
dream
is
a
gift
from
god.
when
you
have
a
great
yearning
for
something,
your
mind
joins
your
heart
and
pushes
for
its
fulfillment.
connecting

to
heart
is
essential
for
the
creative
force
to

on
those
things
in
your
life
that
bring
you
satisfaction.
purity
in

and
heart
may
please
some
-
as
for
me,
i
make
no
boast.
for,
as
you
know,
no
master
of
a
household
has
all
of
his
utensils
made
of
gold;
some
are
wood,
and
yet
they
are
of
use.
it
was
because
of
you.
it
was
because
you
were
by
my
side.
i
will
buy
you
the
world;s
longest-lasting
batteries.

with
me
until
i
die.
be
with
me
forever.
you
are
the
most
precious
treasure
of
mine.
if
every
person
in
this
room
made
it
a
rule
that
wherever
you
are,
whenever
you
can,
you
will
try
to
act
a
little
kinder
than
is
necessary
-
the
world
really
would
be
a
better
place.
and
if
you
do
this,
if
you
act
just
a
little
kinder
than
is
necessary,
someone
else,
somewhere,
someday,
may
recognize
in
you,
in
every
single
one
of
you,
the
face
of
god.
all
things
will
be
produced
in
superior
quantity
and
quality,
and
with
greater
ease,
when
each
man
works
at
a
single
occupation,
in
accordance
with
his
natural
gifts,
and
at
the
right
moment,
without
meddling
with
anything
else.
my
love
is
alive
way
down
in
my
heart.
although
we
are
miles
apart,
if
you
ever
need
a
helping
hand
i;ll
be
there
on
the
double
as
fast
as
i
can.
there;s
a
love
that;s
divine
and
it;s
yours
and
it;s
mine.
like
the
sun
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
should
give
thanks
and
pray
to
the
one.
these
mist-covered
mountains
are
a
home
now
for
me,
but
my
home
is
the
lowlands
and
always
will
be.
someday
you;ll
return
to
your
valleys
and
your
farms
and
you;ll
no
longer
burn
to
be
brothers
in
arms.
have
you
ever
wanted
to
sleep
for
a
hundred
or
thousand
years?
everything
keeps
going
wrong
and
you
don;t
see
any
hope
of
it
getting
better.
you
tell
yourself,
"i;m
sure
things
will
get
better,"
then
another
thing
goes
wrong.
and
when
he
came
to
the
place
where
the
wild
things
are,
they
roared
their
terrible
roars
and
gnashed
their
terrible
teeth
and
rolled
their
terrible
eyes
and
showed
their
terrible
claws
till
max
said
"be
still!"
and
tamed
them
with
the
magic
trick
of
staring
into
all
their
yellow
eyes
without
blinking
once.
and
they
were
frightened
and
called
him
the
most
wild
thing
of
all,
and
made
him
king
of
all
wild
things.
lemon
boy
and
me
started
to
get
along
together.
i
helped
him
plant
his
seeds
and
we;d
mow
the
lawn
in
bad
weather.
it;s
actually
pretty
easy
being
nice
to
a
bitter
boy
like
him,
so
i
got
myself
a
citrus
friend.
there
are
perhaps
twenty
regular
posters
on
the
forum,
and
some
much
larger
and
uncounted
number
of
lurkers.
and
right
now
there
are
three
people
in
chat,
but
there;s
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
who
until
you
are
in
there,
and
the
chat
room
she
finds
not
so
comforting.
it;s
strange
even
with
friends,
like
sitting
in
a
pitch-dark
cellar
conversing
with
people
a
distance
of
about
fifteen
feet.
tears
are
handy
for
washing
away
troubling
and
sad
feelings.
but
when
you
grow
up,
you;ll
learn
that
there
are
things
so
sad,
they
can
never
be
washed
away
by
tears.
that
there
are
painful
memories
that
should
never
be
washed
away.
so
people
who
are
truly
strong
laugh
when
they
want
to
cry.
they
endure
all
of
the
pain
and
sorrow
while
laughing
with
everybody
else.
when
someone
sues
a
wealthy
individual,
they
are
often
met
with
layers
of
legal
protection
and
often
find
that
the
wealthy
person
actually
owns
nothing.
they
control
everything,
but
own
nothing.
i
cheated
on
the
intelligence
test,
i;m
sorry!
but
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
past
few
weeks
have
been
great.
me
and
you
have
done
stuff
together,
you;ve
helped
me
out
with
things,
and
we;re
closer
than
we;ve
ever
been.
i
love
you,
dad,
and
i
think
if
something
can
bring
us
that
close,
it
can;t
possibly
be
bad.
look,
all
i
know
is
what
they
taught
me
at
command
school.
there
are
certain
rules
about
a
war.
rule
number
one
is
young
men
die.
and
rule
number
two
is
doctors
can;t
change
rule
number
one.
when
you
run
with
the
doctor
it
feels
like
it;ll
never
end.
but
however
hard
you
try
you
can;t
run
forever.
everybody
knows
that
everybody
dies
and
nobody
knows
it
like
the
doctor.
but
i
do
think
that
all
the
skies
of
all
the
worlds
might
just
turn
dark
if
he
ever
for
one
moment
accepts
it.
you
can
choose
a
ready
guide
in
some
celestial
voice.
if
you
choose
not
to
decide,
you
still
have
made
a
choice.
you
can
choose
from
phantom
fears
and
kindness
that
can
kill.
i
will
choose
a
path
that;s
clear.
i
will
choose
freewill.
maybe
there
aren;t
any
such
things
as
good
friends
or
bad
friends
-
maybe
there
are
just
friends,
people
who
stand
by
you
when
you;re
hurt
and
who
help
you
feel
not
so
lonely.
maybe
they;re
always
worth
being
scared
for,
and
hoping
for,
and
living
for.
maybe
worth
dying
for
too,
if
that;s
what
has
to
be.
no
good
friends.
no
bad
friends.
only
people
you
want,
need
to
be
with;
people
who
build
their
houses
in
your
heart.
always
look
on
the
bright
side
of
life.
always
look
on
the
light
side
of
life.
if
life
seems
jolly
rotten,
there;s
something
you;ve
forgotten,
and
that;s
to
laugh
and
smile
and
dance
and
sing.
when
you;re
feeling
in
the
dumps,
don;t
be
silly
chumps;
just
purse
your
lips
and
whistle,
that;s
the
thing.
i
love
the
colorful
clothes
she
wears
and
the
way
the
sunlight
plays
upon
her
hair.
i
hear
the
sound
of
a
gentle
word
on
the
wind
that
lifts
her
perfume
through
the
air.
i;m
pickin;
up

i
looked
over

what
did
i
see,
coming
for
to
carry
me
home?
a
band
of
angels,
coming
after

for
to

was
life
like
that?
you
could
look
ahead
to
the
future
or
back
at
the
past,
but
the
present
moved
too
quickly
to
absorb.
maybe
sometimes.
not
today.
he
soon
felt
that
the
fulfillment
of
his
desires
gave
him
only
one
grain
of
the
mountain
of
happiness
he
had
expected.
this
fulfillment
showed
him
the
eternal
error
men
make
in
imagining
that
their
happiness
depends
on
the
realization
of
their
desires.
i
was
just
a
child
when
the
stars
fell
from
the
skies,
but
i
remember
how
they
built
a
cannon
to
destroy
them,
and
in
turn
how
that
cannon
brought
war
upon
us.
war
was
an
abstract
idea,
nothing
more
than
a
show
on
tv.
as
a
child
i
only
saw
it
as
something
that
happened
in
some
far
away
land
-
until
that
final
day
of
summer.
"you
get
what
you
deserve."
it;s
an
old
saying,
one
that
survived
the
years,
because
it;s
true...
for
the
most
part.
but
not
for
everyone.
some
get
more
than
they
deserve,
because
they
believe
they
aren;t
like
everyone
else;
that
the
rules
-
the
ones
for
people
like
me
and
you,
the
people
that
work
and
struggle
to
live
our
lives,
just
live
-
don;t
apply
to
them.
that
they
can
do
anything
and
live
happily
ever
after,
while
the
rest
of
us
suffer.
i;m
the

i
am
the

that;s
standing,

try
to
stand
in
my
way,
;cause
i;ve
been
up
against

just
take
a
look
at
my
face.
i
must
have
left
my
house
at
eight
because
i
always
do.
my
train,
i;m
certain,
left
the
station
when
it
was
due.
i
must
have
read
the
morning
paper
going
into
town,
and
having
gotten
through
the
editorial
no
doubt
i
must
have
frowned.
this
used
to
be
my
playground,
this
used
to
be
my
childhood
dream,
this
used
to
be
the
place
i
ran
to
whenever
i
was
in
need
of
a
friend.
why
did
it
have
to
end?
if
i
had
known
you
were
going
to
come
straight
up
to
my
office
i
would
not
have
bothered
hunting
you
in
the
first
place.
it;s
so
warm
and
calm
inside.
i
no
longer
have
to
hide.
there;s
talk
about
someone
else.
sterling
silver

nothing
really
bothers
her.
she
just
wants
to
love

i
will
move
away
from
here.
you
won;t
be
afraid
of
fear.
no
thought
was
put
into
this.
i
always
knew
it;d
come
to
this.

have
never
been
so
swell.
and
i
have
never
failed
to
fail.

better
at
this
than
i;ve

better
at

ever
be
at
anything.
my
son

a
gift.
he
has
a
gift
and
when
you
acknowledge
that
then
maybe
we
will
have
something
to
talk
about.
every
day
i
searched
for
new
songs,
and
it
was
like
applying
for
asylum.
i
just
needed
someone
to
help
me
escape
from
all
the
silence.
i
just
needed
people
saying
words
about
all
the
things
that
hurt
them.
and
maybe
this
is
why
papi
stopped
listening
to
music,
because
it
can
make
your
body
want
to
rebel.
to
speak
up.
and
even
that
young
i
learned
music
can
become
a
bridge
between
you
and
a
total
stranger.
it
wasn;t
always
so
clear,
but
the
rust
programming
language
is
fundamentally
about
empowerment:
no
matter
what
kind
of
code
you
are
writing
now,
rust
empowers
you
to
reach
farther,
to
program
with
confidence
in
a
wider
variety
of
domains
than
you
did
before.
the
unknown
future
rolls
toward
us.
i
face
it
for
the
first
time
with
a
sense
of
hope,
because
if
a
machine,
a
terminator,
can
learn
the
value
of
human
life,
maybe
we
can,
too.
we;ve
known
each
other
for
many
years
but
this
is
the
first
time
you;ve
ever
come
to
me
for
counsel
or
for
help.
i
can;t
remember
the
last
time
you
invited
me
to
your
house
for
a
cup
of
coffee,
even
though
my
wife
is
godmother
to
your
only
child.
but,
let;s
be
frank
here.
you
never
wanted
my
friendship
and
you
were
afraid
to
be
in
my
debt.
this
is
the
first
day
of
my
life.
i
swear
i
was
born
right
in
the
doorway.
i
went
out
in
the
rain,
suddenly
everything
changed;
they;re
spreading
blankets
on
the
beach.
yours
is
the
first
face
that
i
saw.
i
think
i
was
blind
before
i
met
you.
now
i
don;t
know
where
i
am,
i
don;t
know
where
i;ve
been,
but
i
know
where
i
want
to
go.
in
the
all
night
cafe
at
a
quarter
past
eleven,
same
old
man
sitting
there
on
his
own,
looking
at
the
world
over
the
rim
of
his
teacup,
and
each
tea
lasts
an
hour
and
he
wanders
home
alone.
he
has
a
life,
a
real
life
here.
one
that
keeps
him
grounded
and
decent.
as
you;ve
heard,
there
are
many
people
who
care
about
neal,
people
who
see
him
as
more
than
just
a
criminal.
he;s
frustrating,
i;ll
admit
-
he
drives
me
crazy
on
his
best
days.
i
don;t
always
have
to
know
where
neal
is
or
what
he;s
up
to,
but
i
do
know
that
he
has
a
good
heart
and
a
set
of
principles
that
weren;t
there
six
years
ago
when
he
was
just
another
case
file
that
got
dropped
on
my
desk.
come
and
hold
my
hand.
i
want
to
contact
the
living.
not
sure
i
understand
this
role
i;ve
been
given.
i
sit
and
talk
to
god
and
he
just
laughs
at
my
plans.
my
head
speaks
a
language
i
don;t
understand.
whatever
you
are
physically,
male
or
female,
strong
or
weak,
ill
or
healthy,
all
those
things
matter
less
than
what
your
heart
contains.
if
you
have
the
soul
of
a
warrior,
you
are
a
warrior.
whatever
the
color,
the
shape,
the
design
of
the
shade
that
conceals
it,
the
flame
inside
the
lamp
remains
the
same.
you
are
that
flame.
there;s
something
waiting
in
the
stratosphere,
and
it;s
waiting
just
to
tell
us
what
it;s
doing
here.
if
there;s
one
thing
i
learned
from
rodrick,
it;s
to
set
people;s
expectations
real
low
so
you
end
up
surprising
them
by
practically
doing
nothing
at
all.
for
attractive
lips,
speak
words
of
kindness.
for
lovely
eyes,
seek
out
the
good
in
people.
for
a
slim
figure,
share
your
food
with
the
hungry.
for
beautiful
hair,
let
a
child
run
his
or
her
fingers
through
it
once
a
day.
for
poise,
walk
with
the
knowledge
that
you
never
walk
alone...
i
still
don;t
know
what
it
really
means
to
grow
up.
however,
if
i
happen
to
meet
you,
one
day
in
the
future,
by
then,
i
want
to
become
someone
you
can
be
proud
to
know.
the
simple
fact
is
that
if
you
don;t
enjoy
what
you;re
doing
and
the
people
with
whom
you;re
doing
it,
then
there
is
no
possible
way
that
you
are
ever
going
to
do
it
as
well
as
something
you
do
enjoy.
as
some
wise
person
once
said,
;life
is
not
a
dress
rehearsal.;
this
is
it!
in
an
age
as
agitated
as
ours,
it
no
longer
suffices
just
to
be
advertised
in
the
newspaper.
to
be
advertised
in
this
way
is
the
same
thing
as
being
consigned
to
oblivion.
if
one
is
to
be
noticed,
one
must
at
least
appear
on
the
first
page
under
a
hand
that
points
to
and,
as
it
were,
announces
or
advertises
the
advertisement.
sometimes,
you
read
a
book
and
it
fills
you
with
this
weird
evangelical
zeal,
and
you
become
convinced
that
the
shattered
world
will
never
be
put
back
together
unless
and
until
all
living
humans
read
the
book.
i
had
a

i
had

things
-
things
that
made
sense.
do
you
remember
things
that
made
sense?
things
you
could
count
on?
before
we
all
got
so
lost?
what
are
we
gonna

charlie?
what
am
i
gonna

i
can
just
hear
them
now.
"how
could
you
let
us
down?"
but
they
don;t

what
i

or

this

that
i

with
what
i
always
longed
for.
a
pretty
girl
is
like
a
melody
that
haunts
you
night
and
day.
just
like
the
strain
of
a
haunting
refrain,
she;ll
start
up
on
a
marathon
and
run
around
your
brain.
you
can;t
escape,
she;s
in
your
memory
by
morning,
night,
and
noon.
she
will
leave
you
and
then
come
back
again,
a
pretty
girl
is
just
like
a
pretty
tune.
money,
you;ve
got
lots
of
friends
crowding
around
the
door.
when
you;re
gone
and
spending
ends,
they
don;t
come
no
more.
rich
relations

crust
of
bread
and
such.
you
can
help
yourself,
but
don;t
take
too
much.
mama
may
have,
papa
may
have,
but
god
bless
the
child
that;s

his

that;s
got
his
own.
scars
are
souvenirs
you
never
lose,
the
past
is
never
far.
and
did
you
lose
yourself
somewhere
out
there?
did
you
get
to
be
a
star?
don;t
it
make
you
sad
to
know
that
life
is
more
than
who
you
are?
we
grew
up
way
too
fast
and
now
there;s
nothing
to
believe
and
reruns
all
become
our
history.
a
tired
song
keeps
playing
on
a
tired
radio,
and
i
won;t
tell
no
one
your
name.
so
now
the
sadness
comes
-
the
revelation.
there
is
a
depression
after
an
answer
is
given.
it
was
almost
fun
not
knowing.
yes,
now
we
know.
at
least
we
know
what
we
sought
in
the
beginning.
but
there
is
still
the
question:
why?
and
this
question
will
go
on
and
on
until
the
final
answer
comes.
then
the
knowing
is
so
full,
there
is
no
room
for
questions.
whenever
i;m
alone
with
you,
you
make
me
feel
like
i
am
home
again.
whenever
i;m
alone
with
you,
you
make
me
feel
like
i
am
whole
again.
whenever
i;m
alone
with
you,
you
make
me
feel
like
i
am
young
again.
whenever
i;m
alone
with
you,
you
make
me
feel
like
i
am
fun
again.
the
people
who
succeed
don;t
heed
the
doubters
and
don;t
give
in
to
despair
or
negativity.
they
don;t
talk
about
emptying
the
tank,
they
just
empty
it.
it;s
just
one
more
indispensable
life
lesson
i;ve
learned
from
my
mentor,
coach,
and
friend
james
galanis,
who
even
now
never
stops
reminding
me
that
you
can
achieve
great
things
in
life
if
you
are
true
to
yourself
and
you
do
the
work
when
nobody
is
watching.
sometimes
i
feel
my
heart
will
overflow.
hello,
i;ve
just
got
to
let
you
know,
;cause
i
wonder
where
you
are
and
i
wonder
what
you
do.
are
you
somewhere
feeling
lonely?
or
is
someone
loving
you?
tell
me
how
to
win
your
heart,
for
i
haven;t
got
a
clue.
but
let
me
start
by
saying
i
love
you.
what
is
your
obsession
with
this
money?
my
father
died
when
i
was
thirteen
and
i
inherited
this
money.
you
don;t
think
that
every
day
i
wake
up
and
wish
i
could
give
it
back?
that
i
would
give
it
back
in
a
second
if
i
could
have
one
more
day
with
him?
but
i
can;t,
and
that;s
my
life
and
i
deal
with
it.
i;d
discovered,
after
a
lot
of
extreme
apprehension
about
what
spoons
to
use,
that
if
you
do
something
incorrect
at
table
with
a
certain
arrogance,
as
if
you
knew
perfectly
well
you
were
doing
it
properly,
you
can
get
away
with
it
and
nobody
will
think
you
are
bad-mannered
or
poorly
brought
up.
they
will
think
you
are
original
and
very
witty.
so
you
think
that
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil?
have
you
ever
asked
what
is
the
root
of
money?
money
is
a
tool
of
exchange,
which
can;t
exist
unless
there
are
goods
produced
and
men
able
to
produce
them.
money
is
the
material
shape
of
the
principle
that
men
who
wish
to
deal
with
one
another
must
deal
by
trade
and
give
value
for
value.
money
is
not
the
tool
of
the
moochers,
who
claim
your
product
by
tears
or
of
the
looters,
who
take
it
from
you
by
force.
money
is
made
possible
only
by
the
men
who
produce.
is
this
what
you
consider
evil?
if
there
really
is
a
complete
unified
theory
that
governs
everything,
it
presumably
also
determines
your
actions.
but
it
does
so
in
a
way
that
is
impossible
to
calculate
for
an
organism
that
is
as
complicated
as
a
human
being.
the
reason
we
say
that
humans
have
free
will
is
because
we
can;t
predict
what
they
will
do.
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning,
tell
yourself:
the
people
i
deal
with
today
will
be
meddling,
ungrateful,
arrogant,
dishonest,
jealous
and
surly.
they
are
like
this
because
they
can;t
tell
good
from
evil.
but
i
have
seen
the
beauty
of
good,
and
the
ugliness
of
evil,
and
have
recognized
that
the
wrongdoer
has
a
nature
related
to
my
own
-
not
of
the
same
blood
and
birth,
but
the
same
mind,
and
possessing
a
share
of
the
divine.
and
so
none
of
them
can
hurt
me.
it;s
the
possibility
of
having
a
dream
come
true
that
makes
life
interesting,
he
thought,
as
he
looked
again
at
the
position
of
the
sun,
and
hurried
his
pace.
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that,
in
tarifa,
there
was
an
old
woman
who
interpreted
dreams.
it
used
to
make
you
so
happy,
the
water.
i
think
it;s
brave
to
try
to
be
happy.
you;ve
gotten
so
comfortable
being
unhappy.
wouldn;t
it
be
wonderful
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
choose
to
be
happy,
to
let
the
water
wash
everything
away?
rhymes
trap
you
into
saying
things
you
don;t
want
to
say.
a
word
like
"fire"
is
a
good
example.
before
you
know
it
you;re
reaching
for
desire,
or
to
get
higher,
or
calling
someone
a
liar,
or
putting
them
on
a
pyre,
even
if
that
wasn;t
what
you
were
going
to
say.
i
have
no
idea
how
i
untangled
the
complicated
process
of
words
and
thought,
but
it
happened
quickly
and
naturally.
by
the
time
i
was
two,
all
my
memories
had
words,
and
all
my
words
had
meanings.
we;d
like
to
know
a
little
bit
about
you
for
our
files.
we;d
like
to
help
you
learn
to
help
yourself.

around
you,
all
you

are
sympathetic
eyes.

around
the
grounds
until
you
feel
at
home.
a
yoga
master
came
to
my
office
for
a
consult.
i
asked
her
to
show
me
what
made
her
pain
worse.
she
sat
on
the
floor
in
a
pose
fully
twisting
her
spine,
staying
there
for
several
minutes.
it
took
her
another
few
minutes
to
work
through
the
pain
to
stand
up.
i
stated,
"i
think
i
know
what
is
causing
your
pain
-
doing
that
exercise."
well,
i
can;t
recall
one
time
in
my
life
i;ve
felt
as
lonely
as
i
do
tonight.
i
feel
like
i
could
lay
down
and
get
up
no
more.
it;s
the
damndest
feeling;
i
never
felt
it
before.
tonight
i
feel
like
an
old
violin
soon
to
be
put
away
and
never
played
again.
it;s
a
praying
mantis.
do
you
know
how
they
mate?
the
male
will
sneak
up
on
the
female
and
she;ll
bite
off
his
head
and
the
rest
of
his
body
will
keep
on
mating
and
when
they;re
done
she;ll
eat
him.
she;ll
eat
the
rest
of
him.
if
we
do
our
job
right,
we
never
need
to
go
to
court.
look,
the
reason
we;re
not
a
law
firm?
we
don;t
have
to
play
within
the
rules
of
the
law.
we;re
fixers,
crisis
managers.
we
make
the
problems
of
our
clients
go
away,
big
or
small.
it;s
not
about
solving
some
crime,
it;s
not
about
justice,
it;s
about
our
client.
but
physical
interpretation,
which
is
in
general
a
very
sure
guide
and
had
been
most
often
such
for
me,
misled
me
in
that
case.

as
the
dark

that
fell
across
their
laps
and
that
now
seemed
to
rest
upon
them
as
heavily
as
though
they
possessed
a
measurable
weight
of
their
own.
i
didn;t
get
you
to
do
anything.
i
gave
you
a
name
and
you
made
your
choice,
and
that
choice
was
in
you
before
your
wife
or
any
of
this
other
stuff.
it
was
always
there,
waiting.
didn;t
you
use
that
man
to
be
what
you
were
waiting
to
become?
this
thing,
your
wife,
those
are
just
excuses.
you
think
you
were
superman,

and
hey,
own
it.
you
think
i;d
have
done
less?
that;s
the
kind
of
thing
that
keeps
you
out
of

i
don;t
want
to

forbid

should
have
a

you

you
let
people
walk
over

now
they;ll
be
walking
over
you
for
the

at

i;m
gonna
spend
the

like
kids.
they;re
always
sticky
like
they;ve
got
jam
on
their
hands.
even
if
there;s
no
jam
in
the
house,
somehow,
they;ve
always
got
jam
on
their
hands!
i;m
not
the
right
guy
to
deal
with
that.
i
have
no
patience
for
jam
hands!
he
is
here,
actually
he
was
here!
he;s
just
nipped
out
to
go
to
the
toilet
a
few
minutes
ago.
his
drink
is
over
there
on
the
table
by
those
barrels.
the
only
problem
is
that
no
one
has
ever
actually
seen
a
toilet
in
runescape
so
he
may
take
a
little
while.
my

me
that
i

good

even

the

can
function
in
the

way
as
when
you

to
teach
how
to
live
without
certainty,
and
yet
without
being
paralyzed
by
hesitation,
is
perhaps
the
chief
thing
that
philosophy,
in
our
age,
can
still
do
for
those
who
study
it.
there
are
of
course
those
who
do
not
want

to
speak.
i
suspect
even
now,
orders
are
being
shouted
into

and
men
with

will
soon
be
on
their

why?
because
while
the
truncheon
may
be
used
in
lieu
of
conversation,
words
will
always
retain
their
power.
words
offer
the
means
to
meaning,
and
for
those
who
will
listen,
the
enunciation
of
truth.
and
the
truth
is,
there
is
something
terribly
wrong
with
this
country,
isn;t
there?
furthermore,
those
not
understanding
this
intensity
will
say
you
work
all
the
time
and
probably
resent
it
-
you
make
them
look
bad.
but
for
you,
work
is
play.
oh
baby,
it;s
alright.
it;s
alright
to
feel
like
a

in

old
enough
to
fire
a

give
me
this

just
one
night,

to
know
myself.
what
if
all
of
this
is
a
dream,
and
it
isn;t
even
our
dream,
it;s
that
dog;s
dream?
maybe
we;re
just
existing
in
his
mind
and
all
of
a
sudden
he;ll
go
drink
out
of
the
toilet
and
we;ll
be
gone.
what
will
happen
to
us
if
that
dog
wakes
up?
it
will
be
over.
people
know
what
they

they

why

what

what
what
they

five
years
ago,
we
lost.
all
of
us.
we
lost

we
lost

we
lost
a
part
of

today,
we
have
a
chance
to
take
it
all
back.

of

are

that
doesn;t
mean
we
should
know
what
to
expect.

careful.

out

is

if
there
were
an
answer
i
could
give
you
to
how
the
universe
works,
it
wouldn;t
be
special.
it
would
just
be
machinery
fulfilling
its
cosmic
design.
it
would
just
be
a
big,
dumb
food
processor.
but
since
nothing
seems
to
make
sense,
when
you
find
something
or
someone
that
does,
it;s
euphoria.
and
baseball
was
proof
positive
that
democracy
was
real.
a
baseball
box
score,
after
all,
is
a
democratic
thing.
it
doesn;t
say
how
big
you
are
or
what
religion
you
follow.
it
does
not
know
how
you
voted
or
the
color
of
your
skin.
it
simply
states
what
kind
of
ballplayer
you
were
on
any
particular
day.
old
tom
bombadil
is
a
merry
fellow,
bright
blue
his
jacket
is,
and
his
boots
are
yellow.
none
has
ever
caught
him
yet,
for
tom,
he
is
the
master:
his
songs
are
stronger
songs,
and
his
feet
are
faster.
there
is
neither
happiness
nor
unhappiness
in
this
world;
there
is
only
the
comparison
of
one
state
with
another.
only
a
man
who
has
felt
ultimate
despair
is
capable
of
feeling
ultimate
bliss.
it
is
necessary
to
have
wished
for
death
in
order
to
know
how
good
it
is
to
live.
great,
let;s
round
up
all
the
useless
cats
and
hope
a
tree
falls
on
them.
okay,
i
don;t
know
you,
but
i
do
know
that
you
can
fix
your
attitude.
do
you
wanna
go
home
and
feel
sorry
for
yourself
about
a
man
you
didn;t
wanna
marry?
or
do
you
wanna
go
talk
to
that
cute
boy
who;s
been
looking
at
you
and
give
him
your
number
before
i
throw
him
in
my
benz
for
myself?
one
day
soon,
man
is
going
to
be
able
to
harness
incredible
energies,
maybe
even
the
atom...
energies
that
could
ultimately
hurl
us
to
other
worlds
in...
in
some
sort
of
spaceship.
and
the
men
that
reach
out
into
space
will
be
able
to
find
ways
to
feed
the
hungry
millions
of
the
world
and
to
cure
their
diseases.
they
will
be
able
to
find
a
way
to
give
each
man
hope
and
a
common
future.
and
those
are
the
days
worth
living
for.
and
i
knew
that
in
spite
of
all
the
roses
and
kisses
and
restaurant
dinners
a
man
showered
on
a
woman
before
he
married
her,
what
he
secretly
wanted
when
the
wedding
service
ended
was
for
her
to
flatten
out
underneath
his
feet
like
mrs
willard;s
kitchen
mat.
if
you
loved
someone,
you
loved
him,
and
when
you
had
nothing
else
to
give,
you
still
gave
him
love.
there
will
come
a
time
when
all
of
us
are
dead.
all
of
us.
there
will
come
a
time
when
there
are
no
human
beings
remaining
to
remember
that
anyone
ever
existed
or
that
our
species
ever
did
anything.
there
will
be
no
one
left
to
remember
aristotle
or
cleopatra,
let
alone
you.
everything
that
we
did
and
built
and
wrote
and
thought
and
discovered
will
be
forgotten
and
all
of
this
will
have
been
for
naught.
maybe
that
time
is
coming
soon
and
maybe
it
is
millions
of
years
away,
but
even
if
we
survive
the
collapse
of
our
sun,
we
will
not
survive
forever.
to
pass
beyond
is
what
i
seek,
i
fear
that
i
may
be
too
weak.
and
those
are
few
who;ve
seen
it
through
to
glimpse
the
other
side,
the
promised
land
is
waiting
like
a
maiden
that
is
soon
to
be
a
bride.
if
i
ruled
the
world,
every
man
would
see
the
world
was
his
friend.
there;d
be
happiness
that
no
man
could
end,
no
my
friend,
not
if
i
ruled
the
world.
every
hand
would
be
held
up
high,
there;d
be
sunshine
in
everyone;s
sky.
the
lady
said
the
langston
who
wrote
these
words
is
a
poet.
seems
more
like
a
magician
to
me,
pulling
words
from
my
heart
i
never
knew
i
had.
even
if
someone
says
they;re
doing
fine,
i;m
sure
that;s
just
because
they
haven;t
noticed
that
they;re
truly
lonely.
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
more
times
than
i
care
to
count,
admittedly.
live,
then,
and
be
happy,
beloved
children
of
my
heart,
and
never
forget
that,
until
the
day
god
deigns
to
reveal
the
future
to
man,
the
sum
of
all
human
wisdom
will
be
contained
in
these
two
words:
wait
and
hope.
well,
i
don;t
really
think
that
the
end
can
be
assessed
as
of
itself
as
being
the
end
because
what
does
the
end
feel
like?
it;s
like
saying
when
you
try
to
extrapolate
the
end
of
the
universe,
you
say,
if
the
universe
is
indeed
infinite,
then
how
-
what
does
that
mean?
how
far
is
all
the
way,
and
then
if
it
stops,
what;s
stopping
it,
and
what;s
behind
what;s
stopping
it?
so,
what;s
the
end,
you
know,
is
my
question
to
you.
somewhere
out
there,
someone;s
saying
a
prayer
that
we;ll
find
one
another
in
that
big
somewhere
out
there.
consider
this:
is
the
pious
being
loved
by
the
gods
because
it
is
pious,
or
is
it
pious
because
it
is
being
loved
by
the
gods?
we
speak
of
something
carried
and
something
carrying,
of
something
led
and
something
leading,
of
something
seen
and
something
seeing,
and
you
understand
that
these
things
are
all
different
from
one
another
and
how
they
differ?
so
there
is
also
something
loved
and
-
a
different
thing
-
something
loving.
you
can;t
quit
until
you
try.
you
can;t
live
until
you
die.
you
can;t
learn
to
tell
the
truth
until
you
learn
to
lie.
you
can;t
breathe
until
you
choke.
you
gotta
laugh
when
you;re
the
joke.
there;s
nothing
like
a
funeral
to
make
you
feel
alive.
just
open
your
eyes.
just
open
your
eyes.
and
see
that
life
is
beautiful.
will
you
swear
on
your
life,
that
no
one
will
cry
at
my
funeral?
let;s
just
say
this:
you
will
feel
the
fear
and
pain
known
only
to
humans
who;ve
used
the
notebook.
and
when
it;s
your
time
to
die,
it
will
fall
on
me
to
write
your
name
in
my
death
note.
be
warned
any
human
who;s
used
a
death
note
can
neither
go
to
heaven
nor
hell
for
eternity...
that;s
all.
for
it
is
the
nature
of
a
log
or
stone
to
remain
motionless
on
level
ground.
you
gave
me
wings
and
made
me
fly,
you
touched
my
hand.
i
could
touch
the
sky.
i
lost
my
faith,
you
gave
it
back
to
me,
you
said
no
star
was
out
of
reach.
every
day
that
i
don;t
beg
cardan
for
forgiveness
over
a
feud
he
started
is
a
day
i
win.
he
can
humiliate
me,
but
every
time
he
does
and
i
don;t
back
down,
he
makes
himself
less
powerful.
after
all,
he;s
throwing
everything
he;s
got
at
someone
as
weak
as
i
am
and
it;s
not
working.
he;s
going
to
take
himself
down.
sometimes
i
just
stare
at
myself
in
the
bathroom
mirror.
i
mean,
not
just
for
a
minute
or
two,
but
for
a
really,
really
long
time.
that;s
a
bit
weird,
isn;t
it?
i
just
stand
there
with
the
door
locked.
i
stand
there
and
stare
and
wonder.
i
look
deep
into
my
eyes,
almost
like
i;m
looking
for
something.
i
look
at
my
nose,
my
ears,
my
mouth,
the
shape
of
my
head.
i;m
searching
for
something.
something
i
don;t
understand.
it;s
like
this
person
i;m
looking
at
isn;t
really
me.
when
i
sleep
and
i
dream,
i;m
not
this
person
looking
back
at
me.
take
care
where
you;re
going,
doing
all
the
things
you
do.
even
when
you;re
away
from
me,
i;m
the
closest
thing
to
you.
come
here
when
it;s
over,
when
you
think
you;ve
lost
your
world.
come
here
with
your
restlessness,
and
i
will
calm
you
down.
;cause
it
feels
like
home
when
you
are
here.
what;s
in
your
eyes
;cause
they
talk
to
me.
they
know
how
to
read
my
mind.
i
get
this
feeling
when
you;re
next
to
me,
it;s
like
joy
and
summertime.
i
wanna
be
your
favorite
song
that
will
only
bring
you
joy.
but
now
that
i
never
see
you,
i
can
only
wish
for
more.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i;ll,
i;ll
keep
writing
you.
should
i
stop
by
and
say
hi
or
just
keep
riding
straight?

want
the

than

i
want

it
took
a
lot
of
energy
to
ask

i
don;t

when
i;ll
be
able
to
ask
it
again.
on
my
block,
a
lot
of
people
walk
their
dogs,
and
i
always
see
them
walking
along
with
their
little
poop
bags,
which
to
me
is
just
the
lowest
function
of
human
life.
if
aliens
are
watching
this
through
telescopes,
they;re
gonna
think
the
dogs
are
the
leaders.
if
you
see
two
life
forms,
one
of
them;s
making
a
poop,
the
other
one;s
carrying
it
for
him,
who
would
you
assume
was
in
charge?
to
be
my
own
master.
such
a
thing
would
be
greater
than
all
the
magic
and
all
the
treasures
in
all
the
world!
but
what
am
i
talking
about?
let;s
get
real
here,
it;s
not
gonna
happen.

i
have
often
walked
down

i;m
so
glad
you
came,
i;m
so
glad

remembered,
the
walking
through

the
blindness

of
falling

he
guessed
as
well
as
he
could,
and
crawled
along
for
a
good
way,
till
suddenly
his
hand
met
what
felt
like
a
tiny
ring
of
cold
metal
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
tunnel.
it
was
a
turning
point
in
his
career,
but
he
did
not
know
it.
he
put
the
ring
in
his
pocket
almost
without
thinking;
certainly
it
did
not
seem
of
any
particular
use
at
the
moment.

they
stood
at

are
you,
the
proud
lord
said,
that
i
must
bow
so
low?
only
a
cat
of
a
different
coat,
that;s
all
the
truth
i
know.
i
don;t
believe
you
commissioned
me
to
make
an
offer
on
the
widow;s
claim
to
keep
the
regulators
off
you,
al.
i
think
someone
found
something
out
there
you
want.
i
felt
that
even
when
they
were
polite
they
hardly
saw
me,
that
they
would
have
begged
the
pardon
of
jack
the
bear,
never
glancing
his
way
if
the
bear
happened
to
be
walking
along
minding
his
business.
it
was
confusing.
i
did
not
know
if
it
was
desirable
or
undesirable.
growing
to
hate
decisive
moments,
the
only
thing
within
a
breath
of
real.
so
now
i
fall
to
my
knees
and
beg
in
earnest
to
what
powers
may
govern
the
sky.
just
let
me
sleep
one
night
without
these
dreams
-
these
dreams
that
always
haunt
me.

we;re
going
to
be
taking
you
to
some
of
the
most
exotic

places
in
the

so
relax,

and
don;t

to

faith
isn;t
an
act
of
intelligence,
it;s
an
act
of
imagination.
every
time
you
give
them
a
new
metaphor,
a
mustard
seed,
a
field,
a
garden,
a
vineyard,
it;s
like
pointing
something
out
to
a
cat
-
the
cat
looks
at
your
finger,
not
at
what
you;re
pointing
at.
they
don;t
need
to
understand
it,
they
only
need
to
believe,
and
they
do.
they
imagine
the
kingdom
as
they
need
it
to
be,
they
don;t
need
to
grasp
it,
it;s
there
already,
they
can
let
it
be.
imagination,
not
intellect.
since
we
are
not
yet
fully
comfortable
with
the
idea
the
people
from
the
next
village
are
as
human
as
ourselves,
it
is
presumptuous
in
the
extreme
to
suppose
we
could
ever
look
at
sociable,
tool-making
creatures
who
arose
from
other
evolutionary
paths
and
not
see
beasts
but
brothers,
not
rivals
but
fellow
pilgrims
journeying
to
the
shrine
of
intelligence.
i
can
already
hear
your
tune
calling
me
across
the
room.
when
the
world
and
his
wife
are
on
my
back
again,
not
enough
pleasure
too
much
pain.
when
the
world
is
too
much
with
me,
please
leave,
just
go
away.
before
i
lose
my
mind
completely,
please
leave,
just
go
now.
in
the
sidestreet
something;s

around,
look
around.
all
around
you
walls
are
tumbling
down.
stop
staring
at
the

if
you
know
what
you;re
worth,
go
and
get
what
you;re
worth.
but
you
gotta
be
willing
to
take
the
hits,
and
not

anybody!
cowards
do
that,
and
that
ain;t
you!
you;re
better
than
that!
i
had
felt
it
growing,
this
feeling
that
had
been
hiding
beneath
the
surface
for
some
time
now.
i;d
seen
him,
this
person
who
never
intended
to
be
seen,
and
my
faulty,
silly,
useless
heart
kept
whispering
his
name.
i
clutched
my
chest,
feeling
my
heart
racing.
in
detective
work,
there;s
no
winning
or
losing...
there;s
no
being
inferior
or
superior...
that;s
because
there;s
always
one
and
only
one
truth.
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth.
the
earth
was
without
form,
and
void;
and
darkness
was
on
the
face
of
the
deep.
and
the
spirit
of
god
was
hovering
over
the
face
of
the
waters.
wish
we
could
turn
back
time,
to
the
good
old
days.
when
our
momma
sang
us
to
sleep
but
now
we;re
stressed
out,
we;re
stressed
out,
sometimes
a
certain
smell
will
take
me
back
to
when
i
was
young.
it
wasn;t
dark
beyond
the
cave
door
-
darkness
would
be
something;
darkness
would
mean
that,
with
a
little
light,
there;d
be
plenty
to
see.
darkness
would
be
comforting,
actually.
this
was
so
much
worse.
the
present
is
eternally
flawed.
but
where
you
start
might
not
be
as
important
as
the
direction
you
are
heading.
perhaps
happiness
is
always
to
be
found
in
the
journey
uphill,
and
not
in
the
fleeting
sense
of
satisfaction
awaiting
at
the
next
peak.
much
of
happiness
is
hope,
no
matter
how
deep
the
underworld
in
which
that
hope
was
conceived.
war
must
be,
while
we
defend
our
lives
against
a
destroyer
who
would
devour
all;
but
i
do
not
love
the
bright
sword
for
its
sharpness,
nor
the
arrow
for
its
swiftness,
nor
the
warrior
for
his
glory.
i
love
only
that
which
they
defend.
erdos
knows
about
more
problems
than
anybody
else,
and
he
not
only
knows
about
various
problems
and
conjectures,
but
he
also
knows
the
tastes
of
various
mathematicians.
so
if
i
get
a
letter
from
him
giving
me
three
of
his
conjectures
and
two
of
his
problems,
then
it;s
sure
that
these
are
exactly
the
kind
of
conjectures
and
problems
i;m
interested
in,
and
these
are
exactly
the
kind
of
questions
i
may
be
able
to
answer.
of
course,
this
applies
not
only
to
me,
but
to
everybody
else.
i;m
far
from
home,
no
place
to
go,
but
i
don;t
feel
cold.
i;ve
been
so
blind,
just
lost
my
mind,
but
all
i
have
lost
i
find.
your
face
reminds
me
of
these
games,
the
memories
don;t
erase.
i;ll
never
be
the
same
anymore,
i;m
on
the
highest
stop
with
no
control...
the
presence
of
a
noble
nature,
generous
in
its
wishes,
ardent
in
its
charity,
changes
the
lights
for
us:
we
begin
to
see
things
again
in
their
larger,
quieter
masses,
and
to
believe
that
we
too
can
be
seen
and
judged
in
the
wholeness
of
our
character.
you
stopped
and
smiled
at
me,
asked
me
if
i;d
care
to
dance.
i
fell
into
your
open
arms
and
i
didn;t
stand
a
chance.
now
listen
honey,
i
just
want
to
be
beside
you
everywhere.
the
brain
can
be
a
tool.
it
can
recall
phone
numbers,
solve
math
puzzles,
or
create
poetry.
in
this
way,
it
works
for
the
rest
of
the
body,
like
a
tractor.
but
when
you
can;t
stop
thinking
of
that
math
problem
or
phone
number,
or
when
troubling
thoughts
and
memories
arise
without
your
intent,
it;s
not
your
brain
working,
but
your
mind
wandering.
then
the
mind
controls
you;
then
the
tractor
has
run
wild.
there;s
no
truth
in
the
courtroom.
there;s
just
your
version
of
what
happened
versus
theirs.
that;s
how
the
justice
system
works.
it;s
not
what;s
right
and
what;s
fair.
it;s
who
tells
the
most
convincing
story.
imagine
there;s
no
heaven.
it;s
easy
if
you
try.
no
hell
below
us,
above
us
only
sky.
imagine
all
the
people
living
for
today.
imagine
there;s
no
countries.
it
isn;t
hard
to
do.
nothing
to
kill
or
die
for
and
no
religion
too.
imagine
all
the
people
living
life
in
peace.
according
to
all
known
laws
of
aviation,
there
is
no
way
that
a
bee
should
be
able
to
fly.
its
wings
are
too
small
to
get
its
fat
little
body
off
the
ground.
the
bee,
of
course,
flies
anyway.
because
bees
don;t
care
what
humans

is
impossible.
it;s
four
in
the
morning,
the
end
of
december.
i;m
writing
you
now
just
to
see
if
you;re
better.
new
york
is
cold,
but
i
like
where
i;m
living.
there;s
music
on
clinton
street
all
through
the
evening.
i
hear
that
you;re
building
your
little
house
deep
in
the
desert.
you;re
living
for
nothing
now,
i
hope
you;re
keeping
some
kind
of
record.
yes,
and
jane
came
by
with
a
lock
of
your
hair.
she
said
that
you
gave
it
to
her
that
night
that
you
planned
to
go
clear.
did
you
ever
go
clear?
we
settled
down
together,
in
the
bow
of
the
boat,
and
we
looked
at
the
waves
breaking
into
whitecaps,
and
then
we
looked
at
each
other,
and
through
this
look,
fired
by
the
bitterness
of
our
childhood
and
the
all-consuming
roar
of
the
sea,
something
happened,
something
irremediable:
love,
bittersweet,
until
death.
but
at
the
time
it
was
still
just
a
look.
there
was
once
a
fish
that
lived
in
a
pond.
one
day,
he
met
another
fish
that
used
to
live
in
the
sea.
the
pond
fish
asked,
"what
is
the
sea?"
and
the
sea
fish
said,
"it
is
a
vast
amount
of
water
that
is
a
million,
million
times
bigger
than
your
pond."
the
pond
fish
never
talked
to
the
sea
fish
again
because
he
thought
the
sea
fish
was
a
liar.
very
simple
was
my
explanation,
and
plausible
enough
-
as
most
wrong
theories
are!
light
up
your
face
with
gladness.
hide
every
trace
of
sadness.
although
a
tear
may
be
ever
so
near,
that;s
the
time
you
must
keep
on
trying.
smile,
what;s
the
use
of
crying?
you;ll
find
that
life
is
still
worthwhile
if
you
just
smile.
you
can
tell
me
that
your
dog
ran
away
then
tell
me
that
it
took
three
days.
i;ve
heard
every
joke,
i;ve
heard
every
one
you;d
say.
you
think
there;s
not
a
lot
goin;
on.
look
closer
baby,
you;re
so
wrong.
and
that;s
why
you
can
stay
so
long
when
there;s
not
a
lot
goin;
on.
i
suddenly
had
the
impression
that
i
had
been
left
all
alone,
that
everyone
was
shrinking
away
from
me,
avoiding
me.
you
are,
of
course,
right
to
ask
who
that
everyone
is,
for
although
i;ve
lived
in
petersburg
for
eight
years
now,
i
haven;t
managed
to
make
a
single
friend.
the
good
news
is
that
your
child
has
a
natural
desire
to
do
well.
your
job
as
parent
is
to
bring
out
this
quality
and
cherish
it
until
the
day
your
kids
leave
home,
and
then
some.
all
the
blue
light
reflections
that
color
my
mind
when
i
sleep.
and
the
lovesick
rejections
that
accompany
the
company
i
keep.
all
the
razor
perceptions
that
cut
just
a
little
too
deep.
hey
i
can
bleed
as
well
as
anyone,
but
i
need
someone
to
help
me
sleep.
of
course,
there
are
those
who
learn
after
the
first
few
times.
they
grow
out
of
sports.
and
there
are
others
who
were
born
with
the
wisdom
to
know
that
nothing
lasts.
these
are
the
truly
tough
among
us,
the
ones
who
can
live
without
illusion,
or
without
even
the
hope
of
illusion.
i
am
not
that
grown-up
or
up-to-date.
i
am
a
simpler
creature,
tied
to
more
primitive
patterns
and
cycles.
i
need
to
think
something
lasts
forever,
and
it
might
as
well
be
that
state
of
being
that
is
a
game;
it
might
as
well
be
that,
in
a
green
field,
in
the
sun.
take
a
drink,
my
friend,
and
say
what
you
have
in
your
heart.
but
you
never
drink.
you
never
say.
because
you
are
afraid
of
what
you
have
in
your
heart!
the
clues
we;ve
uncovered
during
our
search
have
led
me
to
believe
there;s
a
strong
possibility
that
tom
is
actually
a
dog,
not
a
small
child
as
we
had
originally
thought.
come
to
think
of
it,
i
seem
to
recall
a
young
girl
walking
about
the
train
with
a
dog
in
her
arms.
i
intend
to
find
her
and
confirm
my
suspicions.
like
a
stranger,
i
am
on
the
outside
looking
in.
i
tore
myself
apart
and
i
am
left
a
skeleton.
and
it;s
been
a
long
way
down
for
me.
it;s
been
a
long
way
down,
but
now
i;m
finally
here.
i
will
never
understand.
people
talk
to
you
a
great
deal
about
your
education,
but
some
good
memory
is
perhaps
the
best
education.
i;ll
be
there
for
you
when
the
rain
starts
to
pour.
i;ll
be
there
for
you
like
i;ve
been
there
before.
i;ll
be
there
for
you
;cause
you;re
there
for
me
too.
i
have
proved
in
my
own
case
that
it
is
of
no
small
benefit
on
finding
oneself
in
bed
in
the
dark
to
go
over
again
in
the
imagination
the
main
outlines
of
the
forms
previously
studied,
or
of
other
noteworthy
things
conceived
by
ingenious
speculation;
and
this
exercise
is
entirely
to
be
commended,
and
it
is
useful
in
fixing
things
in
the
memory.
it;s
sometimes
quite
astonishing
that
a
single,
average
life
is
enough
to
encompass
so
much
that
it;s
at
all
possible
ever
to
have
any
success
in
one;s
work
here.
the
only
thing
that
burns
in
hell
is
the
part
of
you
that
won;t
let
go
of
your
life:
your
memories,
your
attachments.
they
burn
them
all
away,
but
they;re
not
punishing
you,
they;re
freeing
your
soul.
if
you;re
frightened
of
dying
and
you;re
holding
on,
you;ll
see
devils
tearing
your
life
away.
if
you;ve
made
your
peace,
then
the
devils
are
really
angels
freeing
you
from
the
earth.
i
thought
i
had
the
whole
world
in
my
mouth.
i
thought
i
could
say
what
i
wanted
to
say.
for
a
second
that
thought
became
a
sword
in
my
hand.
i
could
slay
any
problem
that
would
stand
in
my
way.
i
felt
just
like
a
crusader.
lion-heart,
a
holy
land
invader.
but
nobody
can
say
what
they
really
mean
to
say,
and
the
impotency
of
speech
came
up
and
hit
me
that
day,
and
i
would
have
made
this
instrumental
but
the
words
got
in
the
way.
it
is
not
knowledge,
but
the
act
of
learning,
not
possession
but
the
act
of
getting
there,
which
grants
the
greatest
enjoyment.
when
i
have
clarified
and
exhausted
a
subject,
then
i
turn
away
from
it,
in
order
to
go
into
darkness
again.
perhaps
one
did
not
want
to
be
loved
so
much
as
to
be
understood.
remember
the
day
i
set
you
free,
i
told
you
you
could
always
count
on
me.
from
that
day
on,
i
made
a
vow.
i;ll
be
there
when
you
want
me,
some
way,
some
how.
imagine
for
a
moment
if
we
once
again
knew
these
few
unremarkable
things:
what
it
is
we;re
eating.
where
it
came
from.
how
it
found
its
way
to
our
table.
and
what,
in
a
true
accounting,
it
really
cost.
we
would
no
longer
need
any
reminding
that
however
we
choose
to
feed
ourselves,
we
eat
by
the
grace
of
nature,
not
industry,
and
what
we;re
eating
is
never
anything
more
or
less
than
the
body
of
the
world.
you
know
what
i;d
like
to
be?
a
cartoon
of
some
kind.
you
know,
like
when
they
get
hit
in
the
head
with
a
frying
pan
or
something,
and
their
head
looks
like
the
frying
pan,
with
the
handle
and
everything?
then
they
just
go
boing
and
their
head
comes
back
to
normal?
wouldn;t
that
be
great?
but
when
a
man
suspects
any
wrong,
it
sometimes
happens
that
if
he
be
already
involved
in
the
matter,
he
insensibly
strives
to
cover
up
his
suspicions
even
from
himself.
intrigued
by
that
enigma,
he
dug
so
deeply
into
her
sentiments
that
in
search
of
interest
he
found
love,
because
by
trying
to
make
her
love
him
he
ended
up
falling
in
love
with
her.
what
makes
a
good
book?
an
author
who
knows
how
to
leave
out
all
the
unnecessary
bulk
and
delivers
a

if
sharks
were
men,
they
would
build
enormous
boxes
in
the
ocean
for
the
little
fish,
with
all
kinds
of
food
inside,
both
vegetable
and
animal.
they
would
take
care
that
the
boxes
always
had
fresh
water,
and
in
general
they
would
make
all
kinds
of
sanitary
arrangements.
if,
for
example,
a
little
fish
were
to
injure
a
fin,
it
would
immediately
be
bandaged,
so
that
it
would
not
die
and
be
lost
to
the
sharks
before
its
time.
so
that
the
little
fish
would
not
become
melancholy,
there
would
be
big
water
festivals
from
time
to
time;
because
cheerful
fish
taste
better
than
melancholy
ones.
he
started
ripping
the
bark,
using
his
fingernails
at
first,
and
when
that
didn;t
work
he
used
the
sharp
edge
of
the
hatchet,
cutting
the
bark
in
thin
slivers,
hairs
so
fine
they
were
almost
not
there.
it
was
painstaking
work,
slow
work,
and
he
stayed
with
it
for
over
two
hours.
twice
he
stopped
for
a
handful
of
berries
and
once
to
go
to
the
lake

drink.

my
friend,
i;ll
say
it
clear.
i;ll
state
my
case
of
which
i;m
certain,
i;ve
lived
a
life
that;s
full.
i
traveled
each
and
every
highway,
and
more,
much
more
than
this,
i
did
it
my
way.
have
you
ever
experienced
a
time
when
no
matter
how
hard
you
tried,
you
failed,
and
the
time
you
spent
felt
wasted?
if
ever
you
feel
such
pangs
of
regret,
try
to
remember
this
tale...
the
story
of
a
young
man;s
quest
to
save
a
sweet
princess.
george,
i
am
an
old
man
and
most
people
hate
me.
but
i
don;t
like
them
either,
so
that
makes
it
all
even.
you
know
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
i
run
practically
everything
in
this
town
but
the
bailey
building
and
loan.
you
know,
also,
that
for
a
number
of
years
i;ve
been
trying
to
get
control
of
it.
or
kill
it.
but
i
haven;t
been
able
to
do
it.
you
have
been
stopping
me.
we
catched
fish,
and
talked,
and
we
took
a
swim
now
and
then
to
keep
off
sleepiness.
it
was
kind
of
solemn,
drifting
down
the
big
still
river,
laying
on
our
backs
looking
up
at
the
stars,
and
we
didn;t
ever
feel
like
talking
loud,
and
it
warn;t
often
that
we
laughed,
only
a
kind
of
low
chuckle.
we
had
mighty
good
weather,
as
a
general
thing,
and
nothing
ever
happened
to
us
at
all,
that
night,
nor
the
next,
nor
the
next.
language
is
one
of
the
keys
to
being
human.
it
allows
us
to
communicate
with
other
human
beings
and
to
leave
a
legacy
of
our
thoughts
and
actions
for
future
generations.
the
dominant
temporal
lobe
helps
to
process
sounds
and

words
into

i;ve
seen
it
watching
me,
that
misty
thing
without
a
face.
it
weaves
my
thoughts,
lined
them
up
in
black
lace.
it
buries
my
shape
and
leaves
no
trace.
tomorrow
i
will
have
no
shame,
and
i
will
start
again.
i
was
reading
about
how
countless
species
are
being
pushed
toward
extinction
by
man;s
destruction
of
forests.
sometimes
i
think
the
surest
sign
that
intelligent
life
exists
elsewhere
in
the
universe
is
that
none
of
it
has
tried
to
contact
us.
you;re
going
in
the
drink
and
i
am
going
to
make
a
cup
of
tea.
underneath
the
floor
boards
is
the
famous
river
thames.
i
hope
for
your
sakes
you
can
hold
your
breath
for
as
long
as
it
takes
to
boil
that
kettle.
after
that,
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question.
don;t
make
assumptions
-
find
the
courage
to
ask
questions
and
to
express
what
you
really
want.
communicate
with
others
as
clearly
as
you
can
to
avoid
misunderstandings,
sadness
and
drama.
with
just
this
one
agreement,
you
can
completely
transform
your
life.
i
can
touch
what
my
heart
used
to
dream
of
long
before
i
knew
someone
warm
like
you.
she
hangs
her
head
and
cries
on
my
shirt.
she
must
be
hurt
very
badly.
tell
me
what;s
making
you
sad,
li?
open
your
door,
don;t
hide
in
the
dark.
you;re
lost
in
the
dark,
you
can
trust
me
;cause
you
know
that;s
how
it
must
be.
there
are
still
faint
glimmers
of
civilization
left
in
this
barbaric
slaughterhouse
that
was
once
known
as
humanity.
he
was
one
of
them.
what
more
is
there
to
say?
they
are
important,
you
understand,
without
being
interesting.
indeed,
i
have
found
that
it
is
usually
in
unimportant
matters
that
there
is
a
field
for
the
observation,
and
for
the
quick
analysis
of
cause
and
effect
which
gives
the
charm
to
an
investigation.
the
larger
crimes
are
apt
to
be
the
simpler,
for
the
bigger
the
crime
the
more
obvious,
as
a
rule,
is
the
motive.
every
single
night
the
same
arrangement.
i
go
out
and
fight
the
fight.
still,
i
always
feel
this
strange
estrangement.
nothing
here
is
real,
nothing
here
is
right.
i;ve
been
making
shows
of
trading
blows,
just
hoping
no
one
knows
that
i;ve
been
going
through
the
motions,
walking
through
the
part.
nothing
seems
to
penetrate
my
heart.
every
time
i
think
of
you
i
feel
shot
right
through
with
a
bolt
of
blue.
it;s
no
problem
of
mine
but
it;s
a
problem
i
find,
living
a
life
that
i
can;t
leave
behind.
there;s
no
sense
in
telling
me
the
wisdom
of
a
fool
won;t
set
you
free.
but
that;s
the
way
that
it
goes,
and
it;s
what
nobody
knows,
while
every
day
my
confusion
grows.
ultimately,
this
is
not
about
solving
your
problems.
it;s
about
realizing
that
there
are
no
problems.
only
situations
-
to
be
dealt
with
now,
or
to
be
left
alone
and
accepted
as
part
of
the
"isness"
of
the
present
moment
until
they
change
or
can
be
dealt
with.
that;s
me
in
the
corner,
that;s
me
in
the
spotlight
losing
my
religion
trying
to
keep
up
with
you,
and
i
don;t
know
if
i
can
do
it.
oh
no,
i;ve
said
too
much,
i
haven;t
said
enough.
now
john
at
the
bar
is
a
friend
of
mine,
he
gets
me
my
drinks
for
free.
and
he;s
quick
with
a
joke
or
to
light
up
your
smoke,
but
there;s
someplace
that
he;d
rather
be.
that
night
of
my
sister;s
18th
birthday
a
lot
of
things
happened.
maybe
more
than
she
knew.
because
that
night
when
my
father
let
karen
go
out,
he
let
karen
go.
maybe
that;s
how
it
had
to
be.
children
leave.
and
parents
stay
behind.
still,
some
things
are
deeper
than
time
and
distance
and
your
father
will
always
be
your
father.
and
he
will
always
leave
a
light
on
for
you.
we
don;t
understand
what
really
causes
events
to
happen.
history
is
the
fiction
we
invent
to
persuade
ourselves
that
events
are
knowable
and
that
life
has
order
and
direction.
that;s
why
events
are
always
reinterpreted
when
values
change.
we
need
new
versions
of
history
to
allow
for
our
current
prejudices.
the
whole
point
was
to
find
a
way
to
practice
nuclear
war
without
destroying
ourselves.
to
get
the
computers
to
learn
from
mistakes
we
couldn;t
afford
to
make.
except
i
never
could
get
joshua
to
learn
the
most
important
lesson.
but
i;ll
tell
you
something:
i
think
you;re
magicians
because
you;re
unhappy.
a
magician
is
strong
because
he
feels
pain.
he
feels
the
difference
between
what
the
world
is
and
what
he
would
make
of
it.
or
what
did
you
think
that
stuff
in
your
chest
was?
a
magician
is
strong
because
he
hurts
more
than
others.
his
wound
is
his
strength.
most
people
carry
that
pain
around
inside
them
their
whole
lives,
until
they
kill
the
pain
by
other
means,
or
until
it
kills
them.
but
you,
my
friends,
you
found
another
way:
a
way
to
use
the
pain.
to
burn
it
as
fuel,
for
light
and
warmth.
you
have
learned
to
break
the
world
that
has
tried
to
break
you.
there;s
sometimes
a
buggy.
how
many
drivers
does
a
buggy
have?
so,
let;s
just
say
i;m
driving
this
buggy,
and
if
you
fix
your
attitude,
you
can
ride
along
with
me.
now
you
will
see
me
one
more
time,
if
you
do
good.
you
will
see
me
two
more
times,
if
you
do
bad.
to
make
you
a
vampire
they
have
to
suck
your
blood.
and
then
you
have
to
suck
their
blood.
it;s
like
a
whole
big
sucking
thing.
mostly
they;re
just
gonna
kill
you.
the
alternative
is
unconsciousness,
the
default
setting,
the
rat
race,
the
constant
gnawing
sense
of
having
had
and
lost
some
infinite
thing.
today
is
the
shadow
of
tomorrow.
today
is
the
present
future
of
yesterday.
yesterday
is
the
shadow
of
today.
the
darkness
of
the
past
is
yesterday.
and
the
light
of
the
past
is
yesterday.
the
days
of
yesterday
are
all
numbered
in
sum,
in
the
world
once,
because
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
yesterday.
love
is
corny,
when
you
get
right
down
to
it.
it
has
two
left
feet.
it
trips
over
itself,
because
it
is
so
large
that
it;s
awkward.
it;s
sort
of
silly,
done
right.
after
all,
how
do
you
convey
something
that
huge?
comfortable,
mullet?
it
seems
sadly
ironic
that
it;s
that
tie
that;s
got
you
into
this
pickle.
now
you
just
take
all
the
time
you
want.
you
can
play
some
music
if
you
like.
happiness
can
be
found,
even
in
the
darkest
of
times,
if
one
only
remembers
to
turn
on
the
light.
haven;t
you
ever
happened
to
come
across
in
a
book
some
vague
notion
that
you;ve
had,
some
obscure
idea
that
returns
from
afar
and
that
seems
to
express
completely
your
most
subtle
feelings?
i
don;t
think
stand-up
should
really
work
on
the
page,
so
the
very
existence
of
this
book
is
an
indication
of
my
ultimate
failure
as
a
comedian.
the
text
of
a
stand-up
set
should
be
so
dependent
on
performance
and
tone
that
it
can;t
really
work
on
the
page,
otherwise
it;s
just
funny
writing.
you
know
that
i
write
slowly.
this
is
chiefly
because
i
am
never
satisfied
until
i
have
said
as
much
as
possible
in
a
few
words,
and
writing
briefly
takes
far
more
time
than
writing
at
length.
sometimes
all
i
want
to
do
is
head
west
on
twenty
in
a
car
i
can;t
afford
with
a
plan
i
don;t
have.
just
me,
my
music
and
the
road.
in
one
respect,
man
is
the
nearest
thing
to
me,
so
far
as
i
must
do
good
to
men
and
endure
them.
but
so
far
as
some
men
make
themselves
obstacles
to
my
proper
acts,
man
becomes
to
me
one
of
the
things
which
are
indifferent,
no
less
than
the
sun
or
wind
or
a
wild
beast.
now
it
is
true
that
these
may
impede
my
action,
but
they
are
no
impediments
to
my
affects
and
disposition,
which
have
the
power
of
acting
conditionally
and
changing:
for
the
mind
converts
and
changes
every
hindrance
to
its
activity
into
an
aid;
and
so
that
which
is
a
hindrance
is
made
a
furtherance
to
an
act;
and
that
which
is
an
obstacle
on
the
road
helps
us
on
this
road.
you
know
what
i
say?
i
say
one
down,
a
couple
hundred
thousand
to
go.
i
don;t
mean
to
get
on
my
high
horse,
but
i;m
telling
you,
i
do
not
like
the
deer.
i;m
sick
of
it;
they;re
taking
over.
they;re
like
rats.
they;re
destroying
the
ecosystem.
i
see
a
dead
deer
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
i
think,
"that;s
a
start."
a
census
taker
once
tried
to
test
me.
i
ate
his
liver
with
some
fava
beans
and
a
nice
chianti.
i
will
need
my
spectacles
and
a
clear
head.
today
i
broke
my
rules
and
i
drank
vodka.
tomorrow
i
will
translate
it,
and
then
i
will
bring
what
i;ve
done
to
your
home.
yes,
i
guess
we
do.
for
instance,
i
think
it;s
wrong
for
you
to
put
your
name
in
sales
reports
you
didn;t
write.
i
think
it;s
wrong
you
keep
a
bag
of
herbs
in
your
bottom
left
drawer.
i
think
it;s
wrong
you
slept
with
the
district
manager;s
wife.
and
you
want
to
know
something?
you
don;t
even
have
to
worry
about
it
because
i
think
it;s
wrong
to
blab
this
kind
of
thing.
you
know,
you
should
be
glad
that
i;m
the
only
one
who
knows
this
stuff
about
you.
anyone
else
here
would
sell
you
down
the
river
in
a
second.
god,
i;m
so
much
better
than
you.
writing
is
hard
work.
a
clear
sentence
is
no
accident.
very
few
sentences
come
out
right
the
first
time,
or
even
the
third
time.
remember
this
in
moments
of
despair.
if
you
find
that
writing
is
hard,
it;s
because
it
is
hard.
there
can
be
no
covenants
between
men
and
lions,
wolves
and
lambs
can
never
be
of
one
mind,
but
hate
each
other
out
and
out
and
through.
what
it
all
comes
down
to
is
that
everything
is
going
to
be
quite
alright.
;cause
i;ve
got
one
hand
in
my
pocket
and
the
other
one
is
flicking
a
cigarette.
close
your
eyes
in
the
night
and
i;ll
be
right
in
front
of
you.
so
sit
back,
enjoy
the
view
until
the
morning.
when
the
sun
comes
from
the
west,
that;s
where
you;ll
find
my
silhouette.
i;ll
ride
a
cloud,
come
back
to
you
without
a
warning.
so
don;t
speak,
;cause
it
only
makes
my
heart
bleed.
no
matter
what
you
say,
i;ll
be
only
just
a
call
away.
the
big
final
rule
for
the
comma
is
one
that
you
won;t
find
in
any
books
by
grammarians.
it
is
quite
easy
to
remember,
however.
the
rule
is:
don;t
use
commas
like
a
stupid
person.
i
mean
it.
more
than
any
other
mark,
the
comma
requires
the
writer
to
use
intelligent
discretion
and
to
be
simply
alert
to
potential
ambiguity.
maybe
you
should
come
with
me
for
a
few
weeks.
see
what
happens.
see
how
much
you
learn.
then,
we;ll
talk
about
your
future.
if
you
challenge
the
conventional
wisdom,
you
will
find
ways
to
do
things
much
better
than
they
are
currently
done.
i
hate
this.
i
hate
being
here.
i
hate
that
you
have
to
be
here.
i
hate
that
there;s
evil
and
that
i
was
chosen
to
fight
it.
i
wish
a
whole
lot
of
the
time
that
i
hadn;t
been.
i
know
a
lot
of
you
wish
i
hadn;t
been,
either.
this
isn;t
about
wishes.
this
is
about
choices.
i
believe
we
can
beat
this
evil.

i;m
opening
the
seal.
i;m
going
down
into
the
hellmouth
and
i
am
finishing
this
once
and
for
all.
it;s
getting
harder
and
harder
for
me
to
return
to
my
true
form.
some
nights,
i
can;t
do
it
at
all.
what;s
causing
it?
iron
roads
and
machines
that
breathe
smoke.
magic

draining

take
me
by
the
hand,
lead
me
to
the

that
you
understand.

of
all
things
i
liked
books
best.
my
father
had
a
large
library
and
whenever
i
could
manage
i
tried
to
satisfy
my
passion
for
reading.
he
did
not
permit
it
and
would
fly
in
a
rage
when
he
caught
me
in
the
act.
he
hid
the
candles
when
he
found
that
i
was
reading
in
secret.
he
did
not
want
me
to
spoil
my
eyes.
but
i
obtained
tallow,
made
the
wicking
and
cast
the
sticks
into
tin
forms,
and
every
night
i
would
bush
the
keyhole
and
the
cracks
and
read,
often
till
dawn.
you
held
me
down,
but
i
got
up,
already
brushing
off
the
dust.
you
hear
my
voice,
you
hear
that
sound
like
thunder,
gonna
shake
your
ground.
you
held
me
down,
but
i
got
up.
get
ready
;cause
i;ve
had
enough.
i
see
it
all,
i
see
it
now.
peripheral
vision
and
the
feel
of
the
keyboard
provide
some
knowledge
about
key
locations.
frequently
used
keys
become
completely
learned,
infrequently
used
keys
are
not
learned
well,
and
the
other
keys
are
partially
learned.
but
as
long
as
a
typist
needs
to
watch
the
keyboard,
the
speed
is
limited.
the
knowledge
is
still
mostly
in
the
world,
not
in
the
head.
you
asked
me
why
i
don;t
have
original
art?
i;ve
had
three
different
names
and
a
dozen
different
aliases
because
of
you.
and
to
be
an
artist,
you
have
to
know
who
you
are.
you
choose
to
be
hurt
rather
than
to
hurt
others,
right?
you;re
nice
and
wonderful.
but
while
it
seems
like
you
are
choosing
both,
you;re
really
forsaking
both.
sometimes
we
talk
all
night
long,
we
don;t
shut
up.
and
when
it;s
late
we;ll
say
we;re
still
wide
awake
so...
we
love
to
talk
about
how
you;ll
come
up
to
visit
me.
and
we;ll
rent
a
car
and
we;ll
drive
upstate.
all
i
could
think
of
was
that
the
teachers
must;ve
found
the
illegal
stash
of
candy
i;d
been
selling
out
of
my
dorms
room.
or
maybe
they;d
realized
i
got
my
essay
on
tom
sawyer
from
the
internet
without
ever
reading
the
book
and
now
they
were
going
to
take
away
my
grade.
or
worse,
they
were
going
to
make
me
read
the
book.

with
gene
therapy,
we
can

splice
in

i
believe
that
for
every
one
of
these
anxious,
anguished
people
who
have
come

this
evening
there
must
be
hundreds
of
others
also

never

simply
because

perhaps
they
watched

but
never
made

a

in
which
the

is
brought
to

on

when
this
is
done,
a
deep
calm
pervades

and

a
state
of
tranquility
which
must
be
experienced

be
understood.

in

you
found

it
was
when
they
threatened
to
kill
you
unless
you
gave
them
what
they

told

you

my

most
people
believe
that
reality
is

are
deceiving.
but
those
of
us
who

we
can
only
truly
know

you
can
never

i;m
so
glad
you
came,
i;m
so
glad
you
remembered,
to
see
how
we;re
ending
our
last
dance
together.
expectant,
too
punctual,
but
prettier
than
ever,
i
really
believe
that
this

it;s
forever.
when
i
first
learned
the
truth,
i
thought
sebastian;s
life
would
be
ruined.
but
seeing
you,
i
realized
everything
would
be
fine.
because
someone
still
loved
him.

i;m
waving
goodbye,
so
i;ll
spread
out
my
wings
and
fly.
time,
dear
friend,
time
brings
round
opportunity;
opportunity

the

we
have
ventured
the
more
we
gain,
when
we
know
how
to

a
faerie
heart
is
different
from
a
human
heart.
human
hearts
are
elastic.
they
have
room
for
all
sorts
of
passions,
and
they
can
break
and
heal
and
love
again
and
again.
faerie
hearts
are
evolutionarily
less
sophisticated.
they
are
small
and
hard,
like
tiny
grains
of
sand.
our
hearts
are
too
small
to
love
more
than
one
person
in
a
lifetime.
the
minipirates
had
little
iron
hooks
instead
of
hands
and
wooden
stumps
instead
of
proper
legs,
nor
did
i
ever
see
one
without
an
eyepatch.
at
first
i
thought
they;d
been
wounded
during
their
reckless
attempts
to
board
a
prize,
but
i
later
learned
that
they
were
born
that
way,
complete
with
hats
and
moustaches.
death
is
but
crossing
the
world,
as
friends
do
the
seas;
they
live
in
one
another
still.
for
they
must
needs
be
present,
that
love
and
live
in
that
which
is
omnipresent.
in
this
divine
glass
they
see
face
to
face;
and
their
converse
is
free,
as
well
as
pure.
this
is
the
comfort
of
friends,
that
thought
they
may
be
said
to
die,
yet
their
friendship
and
society
are,
in
the
best
sense,
ever
present,
because
immortal.
in
the
beginning
there
was
only
a
small
amount
of
injustice
abroad
in
the
world,
but
everyone
who
came
afterwards
added
their
portion,
always
thinking
it
was
very
small
and
unimportant,
and
look
where
we
have
ended
up
today.
of
all
the
gin

in

the

it
led
me
by
the
hand,
as
if
to
fill
the
niches
in
the
memories
in
my
oozing
brain
fluid.
without
even
a
destination,
we
kept
walking.
disgusting
clouds
were
floating
in
the
sky.
i
already
know
what
will
happen
to
me
the
next
time
i
wake
up.
no
matter
what
they
call
us,
however
they
attack,
no
matter
where
they
take
us,
we;ll
find
our
own
way
back.
i
can;t
deny
what
i
believe,
i
can;t
be
what
i;m
not.
i
know
i;ll
love
forever,
i
know
no
matter
what.
the
problem
with
microsoft
is
they
just
have
no
taste.
they
have
absolutely
no
taste,
and
what
that
means
is,
and
i
don;t
mean
that
in
a
small
way,
i
mean
that
in
a
big
way.
the
time
has
come,
to
say
fair;s
fair.
to
pay
our
rent,
now,
to
pay
our
share.
the
time
has
come,
a
fact;s
a
fact.
it
belongs
to
them,
we;re
gonna
give
it
back.
how
do
we
dance
when
our
earth
is
turning?
how
do
we
sleep
when
our
beds
are
burning?
if
anybody
asks
you
if
you
in
this
game,
you
tell
;em
you
in
it
for
life,
a;ight?
you
play
it
hard,
you
play
it
tight,
and
you
make
sure
they
know
you
gonna
stand
by
your
people.
no
loose
talk,
no
second
thoughts
and
no
snitching.
play
it
like
that.
i
remember
the
night
you
were
charged
with
practicing
iambic
pentameter
without
a
license.
i;ll
live
on
and
carry
your
name,
and
be
what
you
always
thought
i
could
be.
i
hope
we
meet
at
the
end.
but
i;ll
never
forgive
the
world
for
taking
my
best
friend.
using
the
laser
guide,
you
can
steer
your
rocket
past
the
gunship
defenses
and
prevent
it
from
shooting
down
your
rocket.
this
will
only
anger
it
at
first.
but
if
you
can
survive
long
enough
to
make
several
direct
hits,
you
will
be
rewarded
with
a
prize
worthy
of
any
mantle
piece.
yes,
steve,
i
can
tell
you
those
things
because
when
i
said
that
we
weren;t
releasing
any
information
whatsoever
i
meant
except
his
name,
his
address,
his
ethnicity,
and
what
we
think
his
motives
are.
look,
i
understand
too
little
too
late.
i
realize
there
are
things
you
say
and
do
you
can
never
take
back.
but
what
would
you
be
if
you
didn;t
even
try?
you
have
to
try.
so
after
a
lot
of
thought,
i;d
like
to
reconsider.
please,
if
it;s
not
too
late,
make
it
a
cheeseburger.
i
tried
several
times
to
call
her,
but
after
the
first
call,
she
wouldn;t
come
to
the
phone
any
longer.
i
also
sent
flowers
but
with
no
luck.
the
smell
of
the
flowers
only
made
me
sicker.
the
headaches
got
worse.
i
think
i
got
stomach
cancer.
i
shouldn;t
complain
though.
you;re
only
as
healthy
as
you
feel.
it
is
the
view
of
the
ministry
that
theoretical
knowledge
will
be
sufficient
to
get
you
through
your
examinations,
which
after
all,
is
what
school
is
all
about.
and
how
is
theory
supposed
to
prepare
us
for
what;s
out
there?
there
is
nothing
out
there
dear,
who
do
you
imagine
would
want
to
attack
children
like
yourself.
oh,
i
don;t
know,
maybe,
lord
voldemort?
you
can
trust
us
to
stick
to
you
through
thick
and
thin
-
to
the
bitter
end.
and
you
can
trust
us
to
keep
any
secret
of
yours
-
closer
than
you
yourself
keep
it.
but
you
cannot
trust
us
to
let
you
face
trouble
alone,
and
go
off
without
a
word.
we
are
your
friends,
frodo.
anyways:
there
it
is.
we
know
most
of
what
gandalf
has
told
you.
we
know
a
good
deal
about
the
ring.
we
are
horribly
afraid
-
but
we
are
coming
with
you;
or
following
you
like
hounds.
i
think
she
wanted
you,
of
all
people,
to
know
the
truth.
she
wanted
to
live
on
in
your
memory,
not
as
a
soldier,
but
as
a
woman.
but
-
she
was
forbidden
to
tell
you
herself.
and
that;s
why
she
told
me.
snake,
history
will
never
know
what
she
did.
no
one
will
ever
learn
the
truth.
her
story...
her
debriefing,
will
endure
only
in
your
heart.
everything
she
did,
she
did
for
her
country.
she
sacrificed
her
life
and
her
honor
for
her
native
land.
she
was
a
real
hero.
she
was
a
true
patriot.
i
find
it
wholesome
to
be
alone
the
greater
part
of
the
time.
to
be
in
company,
even
with
the
best,
is
soon
wearisome
and
dissipating.
i
love
to
be
alone.
i
never
found
the
companion
that
was
so
companionable
as
solitude.
i
was
long
into
my
second
decade
of
living
single
before
i
came
to
see
my
friends
in
the
city
for
what
they
were:
my
personal
community,
my
urban
tribe.
look
and
think
as
far
ahead
as
possible.
often,
a
driver;s
natural
reaction
is
to
look
at
the
wall
or
the
point
you;re
just
about
to
get
to.
that;s
not
enough.
you
won;t
drive
a
smooth,
flowing
line
if
you
don;t
look
far
ahead.
looking
well
ahead,
and
concentrating
on
getting
to
where
i;m
looking,
seems
to
really
help
me.
well,
all
i
can
say
gerry
is
that
some
marches
are
for
things
and
some
are
against
things,
but
never
has
there
been
a
march
for
absolutely
nothing.
now
is
our
chance
to
put
that
right.
grab
your
toaster
and
kettle
and
discover
like
me,
how
great
it
feels
to
devote
yourself
to
something
truly
purposeless.
by
doing
something
with
absolutely
no
point
to
it,
we
eliminate
the
possibility
of
failure,
because
in
a
sense
the
worse
it
may
go
then
the
more
it
can
be
considered
a
success.
the
cost
of
a
thing
is
the
amount
of
what
i
will
call
life
which
is
required
to
be
exchanged
for
it,
immediately
or
in
the
long
run.
now
you
make
sure
you
tell
old
marlo
i
burned
the
money.
;cause
it
ain;t
about
that
paper.
it;s
about
me
hurtin;
his
people
and
messin;
with
his
world.
tell
that
boy
he
ain;t
man
enough
to
come
down
to
the
street
with
omar.
you
tell
him
that!
if
you
have
been
rejected
many
times
in
your
life,
then
one
more
rejection
isn;t
going
to
make
much
difference.
if
you;re
rejected,
don;t
automatically
assume
it;s
your
fault.
the
other
person
may
have
several
reasons
for
not
doing
what
you
are
asking
her
to
do:
none
of
it
may
have
anything
to
do
with
you.
perhaps
the
person
is
busy
or
not
feeling
well
or
genuinely
not
interested
in
spending
time
with
you.
rejections
are
part
of
everyday
life.
don;t
let
them
bother
you.
keep
reaching
out
to
others.
when
you
begin
to
receive
positive
responses
then
you
are
on
the
right
track.
it;s
all
a
matter
of
numbers.
count
the
positive
responses
and
forget
about
the
rejections.
if
i
can;t
find
the
cure,
i;ll
fix
you
with
my
love.
no
matter
what
you
know,
i;ll
fix
you
with
my
love.
and
if
you
say
you;re
okay,
i;m
gonna
heal
you
anyway.
promise

but
sometimes
illumination
comes
to
our

at
the
very
moment
when
all
seems

we

at

at

we
stumble
unconsciously
against
the

we
can
enter

in

i
had
a
job,
i
had
a
girl.
i
had
something
going,
mister,
in
this
world.
i
got
laid
off
down
at
the
lumber
yard,
our
love
went
bad,
times
got
hard.
now
i
work
down
at
the
carwash,
where
all
it
ever
does
is
rain.
don;t
you
feel
like
you;re
a
rider
on
a

the

with
many
a

but
i;m
strong,
strong
enough
to
carry
him.
he
ain;t
heavy,
he;s
my
brother.
what
would
you
think
if
i
sang
out
of
tune?
would
you
stand
up
and
walk
out
on
me?
lend
me
your
ears
and
i;ll
sing
you
a
song
and
i;ll
try
not
to
sing
out
of
key.
oh
i
get
by
with
a
little
help
from
my
friends.
my
tea;s
gone
cold,
i;m
wondering
why
i
got
out
of
bed
at
all.
the
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window,
and
i
can;t
see
at
all.
and
even
if
i
could
it;d
all
be
gray,
but

picture
on
my
wall.

reminds
me
that
it;s
not

very
often
research
which
has
deeply
interested
me
while
i
was
investigating
it
loses
its
interest
for
me
just
after
i
have
the
solution,
unhappily
at
a
time
which
coincides
with
the
period
when
i
have
to
record
it.
after
a
while,
say
a
couple
of
months,
i
come
to
a
more
just
appreciation
of
it.
the
naked
cannot
clothe
the
poor
in
spirit
with
oxygen,
and
the
wine
i
tasted
reminded
me
of
the
night
she
took
advantage
of
my
advances
rather
than
the
blood
sacrifice
that
i
can
make
a
better
decision.
i
still
want
to
smack
him.
or
remind
him
that
the
last
transfer
we
had
from
abnegation,
who
is
sitting
right
next
to
him,
managed
to
knock
out
some
of
his
teeth,
so
who
knows
what
this
next
one
will
do.
there
was
a
demon
that
lived
in
the
air.
they
said
whoever
challenged
him
would
die.
their
controls
would
freeze
up,
their
planes
would
buffet
wildly,
and
they
would
disintegrate.
the
demon
lived
at
mach
1
on
the
meter,
seven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
an
hour,
where
the
air
could
no
longer
move
out
of
the
way.
he
lived
behind
a
barrier
through
which
they
said
no
man
could
ever
pass.
they
called
it
the
sound
barrier.
at
night
i;m
driving
in
your
car,
pretending
that
we;ll
leave
this
town.
we;re
watching
all
the
streetlights
fade.
and
now
you;re
just
a
stranger;s
dream,
i
took
your
picture
from
my
frame.
and
now
you;re
nothing
like
you
seem,
your
shadow
fell
like
last
night;s
rain.
i
have
these
thoughts
so
often,
i
ought
to
replace
that
slot
with
what
i
once
bought;
;cause
somebody
stole
my
car
radio
and
now
i
just
sit
in
silence.
i
called
betsy
again
at
her
office
and
she
said
maybe
we;d
go
to
a
movie
together
after
she
gets
off
work
tomorrow.
that;s
my
day
off.
at
first
she
hesitated
but
i
called
her
again
and
then
she
agreed.
night
gathers,
and
now
my
watch
begins.
it
shall
not
end
until
my
death.
i
shall
take
no
wife,
hold
no
lands,
father
no
children.
i
shall
wear
no
crowns
and
win
no
glory.
i
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post.
i
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness.
i
am
the
watcher
on
the
walls.
i
am
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.
i
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
night;s
watch,
for
this
night
and
all
the
nights
to
come.
well,
that;s
the
heart
of
our
problem
isn;t
it?
you
don;t
trust
me.
you
still
don;t
trust
me.
i
may
be
a
ward
of
the
state,
and
i
will
do
my
job
for
the
fbi,
but
as
far
as
my
personal
life
goes,
we
are
done.
we;re
done.
something
inside
me
has
always
been
there.
but
now
it;s
awake.
and
i
don;t
know
what
it
is
or

in

that
she

i
picked
the

i;m
afraid
of
where

don;t
make
me

i;m
always
so
dubious
of

like
i
can;t
afford
to
replace
what
you;ve
spent.
come
on,

nina
twin
is
trying
to

and
i
really
hope
she

me
straight,

too
dense

being
able
to
quit

that
don;t

is
integral
to
being
a

going
into
a
project
or
job
without
defining
when
worthwhile
becomes
wasteful
is
like
going
into
a
casino
without
a
cap
on
what
you
will
gamble:
dangerous
and
foolish.
well,
isn;t
this
great,
we;ve
all
learned
something.
tony
can;t
choose
who
his
sister;s
gonna
fall
for,
monica
can;t
choose
who
she;s
gonna
fall
for,
and
i
think
that
i;ve
learned
the
greatest
lesson
of
all.
i
love
being
lifted.
oh,
i
don;t
know.
i
mean,
what
makes
you
think
that
elves
are
any
more
magical
than
something
like...
like
a
whale?
you
know
what
i
mean?
what
if
i
told
you
a
story
about
how
underneath
the
ocean,
there
was
this
giant
sea
mammal
that
used
sonar
and
sang
songs
and
it
was
so
big
that
its
heart
was
the
size
of
a
car
and
you
could
crawl
through
the
arteries?
i
mean,
you;d
think
that
was
pretty
magical,
right?
and
the
great

who
must

in
an
upheaval,
the
great
owners
with
access
to
history,
with

to
read
history
and
to
know
the
great
fact:
when
property
accumulates
in
too
few
hands
it
is
taken

and
that
companion
fact:

a

she
would
not
say
of
anyone
in
the
world
now
that
they
were
this
or
were
that.
she
felt
very
young;
at
the
same
time
unspeakably
aged.
she
sliced
like
a
knife
through
everything;
at
the
same
time
was
outside,
looking
on.
she
had
a
perpetual
sense,
as
she
watched
the
taxi
cabs,
of
being
out,
out,
far
out
to
the
sea
and
alone;
she
always
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
very,
very
dangerous
to
live
even
one
day.
is
it
a
shame
that
i
can;t
accept
love?

i
too
burned
out
to
move
towards
what

alive

smart

there
is
a
theory
which
states
that
if
anybody
ever
discovers
exactly
what
the
universe
is
for
and
why
it
is
here,
it
will
instantly
disappear
and
be
replaced
by
something
even
more
bizarre
and
inexplicable.
there
is
another
theory
which
states
that
this
has
already
happened.
it
is
vitally
important
for
us
to
keep
engaging
with
the
world,
with
people
whose
lives
are
different
from
our
own.
travel
opens
minds
and
hearts,
expands
our
thinking,
and
breeds
tolerance
-
all
things
that
are
fundamentally
good
for
societies.
well
if
you
think
i;m
that
type
of
girl,
you;ve
got
another
thing
coming,
mister.
;cause
i
don;t
do
one-night
stands,
i
don;t
date
musicians,
and
i
don;t
roll
over
just
because
you
bought
in
this
game.
fair
warning
-
i;ll
be
resisting
your
every
move
and
enjoying
your
every
mistake.
i
trust
it
won;t
be
the
first
time
you
made
mistakes
with
the
opposite
sex.
i
would
rather
not
have
upset
him,
but
i
couldn;t
see
any
reason
to
change
my
life.
looking
back
on
it,
i
wasn;t
unhappy.
when
i
was
a
student,
i
had
lots
of
ambitions
like
that.
but
when
i
had
to
give
up
my
studies
i
learned
very
quickly
that
none
of
it
really
mattered.
i;d
been
asked
this
question
hundreds
of
times
over
the
years.
one

rule

one
ring
to
find
them,
one
ring
to

them
all
and
in

them.
it;s
not
time
to
make
a
change.
just
sit
down
and
take
it
slowly.

that;s
your

there;s
so

all
alone
in
the

i
can
dream
of
the
old
days,

beautiful
then.
i

i
knew
what
happiness
was.

the
memory
live

can

there
she
goes.
there
she
goes
again,
racing
through
my
brain.
and
i
just
can;t
contain
this
feeling
that
remains.
if
one
day
i
could
get
out
of
here,
i
would
allow
myself
to
be
crazy.
everyone
is
indeed
crazy,
but
the
craziest
are
the
ones
who
don;t
know
they;re
crazy;
they
just
keep
repeating
what
others
tell
them
to.
the
world
ain;t
all
sunshine
and
rainbows.
it;s
a
very
mean
and
nasty
place
and
i
don;t
care
how
tough
you
are
it
will
beat
you
to
your
knees
and
keep
you
there
permanently
if
you
let
it.
you,
me,
or
nobody
is
gonna
hit
as
hard
as
life.
but
it
ain;t
about
how
hard
you
hit.
it;s
about
how
hard
you
can
get
hit
and
keep
moving
forward.
that;s
how
winning
is
done!
now
if
you
know
what
you;re
worth
then
go
out
and
get
what
you;re
worth.
but
you;ve
gotta
be
willing
to
take
the
hits,
and
not
pointing
fingers
saying
you
ain;t
where
you
wanna
be
because
of
him,
or
her,
or
anybody!
cowards
do
that
and
that
ain;t
you!
you;re
better
than
that!
when
i
look
up
at
the
night
sky,
and
i
know
that,
yes,
we
are
part
of
this
universe,
we
are
in
this
universe,
but
perhaps
more
important
than
both
of
those
facts
is
that
the
universe
is
in
us.
when
i
reflect
on
that
fact,
i
look
up
-
many
people
feel
small,
;cause
they;re
small
and
the
universe
is
big,
but
i
feel
big,
because
my
atoms
came
from
those
stars.
you;re
not
like
the
others.
i;ve
seen
a
few;
i
know.
when
i
talk,
you
look
at
me.
when
i
said
something
about
the
moon,
you
looked
at
the
moon,
last
night.
before
me
there
stands
an
opportunity,
there
for
the
taking
in
this
moment
-
this
exact
moment.
i
shall
prepare
myself
to
face
a
monster
of
which
only
i
may
conquer.
conjure
the
power
bestowed
upon
our
souls,
conjure
the
power.
in
this
particular
instance
it
is
not
at
all
far-fetched
to
think
of
it
as
a
piercing
ray
of
light,
penetrating
the
chromatic
coils
and
darkness
of
the
storm
and
magically
initiating
the
process
of
dispersal.
imagine
for
a
moment
that
among
humans
some
people
can
fly.
government
staff
come
and
tell
you
that
you
can
take
a
course
that
will
teach
you
how.
this
sounds
great,
and
one
hears
of
emotional
accounts
of
what
it
is
like
to
soar
in
the
sky.
but
you
have
no
personal
experience
of
what
flying
feels
like.
to
learn
it
you
must
go
for
six
to
nine
months
daily
to
school.
you
do
exercises
like
flapping
your
arms
but
you
never
really
take
off.
and
you
do
not
often
need
to
fly
anywhere.
whenever
you
do,
you
can
either
take
the
plane
or
send
a
relative
who
can
fly
to
do
what
is
needed.
so,
is
the
benefit
worth
the
effort?
if
i;m
curt
with
you
it;s
because
time
is
a
factor.
i
think
fast,
i
talk
fast
and
i
need
you
guys
to
act
fast
if
you
wanna
get
out
of
this.
so,

liquor
dealers
had
to
be
where
they
could
run
into
people
who
might
buy
their
consignments
like
detectives
had
to
be
where
they
were
likeliest
to
hear
the
latest
about
a
big
tanker
full
of
grain
alcohol
that
for
some
reason
hadn;t
shown
up
yet.
here;s
what
i
think
happened:
the
old
man
heard
the
fight
between
the
boy
and
his
father
a
few
hours
earlier.
then,
when
he;s
lying
in
his
bed,
he
heard
a
body
hit
the
floor
in
the
boy;s
apartment,
heard
the
woman
scream
from
across
the
street,
got
to
his
front
door
as
fast
as
he
could,
heard
somebody
racing
down
the
stairs
and
assumed
it
was
the
boy!
right,
i
am
going
to
tell
you
how
this
works.
you;re
going
in
the
drink
and
i
am
going
to
make
a
cup
of
tea.
underneath
the
floor
boards
is
the
famous
river
thames.
i
hope
for
your
sakes
you
can
hold
your
breath
for
as
long
as
it
takes
to
boil
that
kettle.
after
that,
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question,
one
question.
you
are
going
to
give
me
a
name
and
if
it;s
the
right
name,
i
send
you
home
warm
and
dry
in
a
fresh
set
of

it;s

wrong

you;ll

when
i
lay
with
you
i
could
stay
there.
close
my
eyes,
feel
you
here
forever.
you
and
me
together,
nothing
gets
better.
i
set
fire
to
the
rain,
watched
it
pour
as
i
touched
your
face.
well,
it
burned
while
i
cried,
;cause
i
heard
it
screaming
out
your
name.
there;s
not
a
day
goes
by
i
don;t
feel
regret.
not
because
i;m
in
here,
because
you
think
i
should.
i
look
back
on
the
way
i
was
then:
a
young,
stupid
kid
who
committed
that
terrible
crime.
i
want
to
talk
to
him.
i
want
to
try
to
talk
some
sense
to
him,
tell
him
the
way
things
are.
but
i
can;t.
that
kid;s
long
gone,
and
this
old
man
is
all
that;s
left.
i
got
to
live
with
that.
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
yet
there
are
those
who
open
many
eyes.
eyes
are
the
mirror
of
the
soul,
someone
has
said.
so
we
look
closely
at
the
eyes
to
see
the
nature
of
the
soul.
sometimes
when
we
see
the
eyes
-
those
horrible
times
when
we
see
the
eyes,
eyes
that,
that
have
no
soul
-
then
we
know
a
darkness,
then
we
wonder:
where
is
the
beauty?
there
is
none
if
the
eyes
are
soulless.
i
know
you,
i
walked
with
you
once
upon
a
dream.
i
know
you,
the
gleam
in
your
eyes
is
so
familiar
a
gleam.
yet
i
know
it;s
true
that
visions
are
seldom
all
they
seem,
but
if
i
know
you,
i
know
what
you;ll
do
-
you;ll
love
me
at
once,
the
way
you
did
once
upon
a
dream.
dreams.
each
man
longs
to
pursue
his
dream.
each
man
is
tortured
by
this
dream,
but
the
dream
gives
meaning
to
his
life.
even
if
the
dream
ruins
his
life,
man
cannot
allow
himself
to
leave
it
behind.
in
this
world,
is
man
ever
able
to
possess
anything
more
solid,
than
a
dream?
there
are
many
ways
to
get
out;
surrender
is
one,
losing
is
another.
winning,
cheating,
which
i
don;t
recommend,
but
you
have
to
do
something.
you
have
to
have
a
strategy.
see
the
number
one
rule
in
chess
is
this;
whatever
you
do,
don;t
play
the
other
person;s
game.
play
your
own...
your
move.
a
necessary
sacrifice
to
bring
peace
to
this
planet.
we
can
not
let
the
humans
pay
for
our
mistakes.
it;s
been
an
honor
serving
with
you
all.
autobots,
roll
out!
whether
this
tale
be
true
or
false,
none
can
tell,
for
none
were
there
to
witness
it
themselves.
the
prize
returns
to
me.
did
you
imagine
that
i
would
let
you
steal
it
from
me?
you
what?
that
jewel
belongs
to
my
father
and
you
know
it.
your
father,
a
good-for-nothing
scavenger
just
like
his
daughter!
the
men
in
the
room
suddenly
realized
that
they
didn;t
want
to
know
her
better.
she
was
beautiful,
but
she
was
beautiful
in
the
way
a
forest
fire
was
beautiful:
something
to
be
admired
from
a
distance,
not
up
close.
i
have
long
loved
you,
and
loved
you
even
before
i
knew
that
i
did.
if
all
else
perished,
and
he
remained,
i
should
still
continue
to
be;
and
if
all
else
remained,
and
he
were
annihilated,
the
universe
would
turn
to
a
mighty
stranger.
if
i
told
you
that
a
flower
bloomed
in
a
dark
room
would
you
trust
it?
i
mean,
i
write
poems
in
these
songs
dedicated
to
you
when
you;re
in
the
mood
for
empathy,
there;s
blood
on
my
pen.
what
is
finished
is
the
idea
that
this
great
country
is
dedicated
to
the
freedom
and
flourishing
of
every
individual
in
it.
it;s
the
individual
that;s
finished.
it;s
the
single,
solitary
human
being
that;s
finished.
it;s
every
single
one
of
you
out
there
that;s
finished,
because
this
is
no
longer
a
nation
of
independent
individuals.
and
these
medications
have
a
legitimate
use.
they;ve
helped
a
lot
of
people.
it;s
a
generational
thing.
you
know
teenagers
always
find
a
way
to
abuse
something.
and
why
not,
right?
being
zonked
out
of
your
mind
is
a
lot
more
fun
than
dealing
with
your
problems.
well,
things
are
getting
pretty
serious
right
now.
i
mean,
we
chat
online
for,
like,
two
hours
every
day
so
i
guess
you
could
say
things
are
gettin;
pretty
serious.
what
is
the
point
of
being
alive
if
you
don;t
at
least
try
to
do
something
remarkable?
there
is
no
good
and
evil,
there
is
only
power
and
those
too
weak
to
seek
it.
the
real
evil
is
the
power
to
kill
people.
someone
who
finds
himself
with
that
power
is
cursed.
no
matter
how
you
use
it,
anything
obtained
by
killing
people
can
never
bring
true
happiness.
the
proper
purpose
of
law
is
to
use
the
power
of
its
collective
force
to
stop
this
fatal
tendency
to
plunder
instead
of
to
work.
all
the
measures
of
the
law
should
protect
property
and
punish
plunder.
but,
generally,
the
law
is
made
by
one
man
or
one
class
of
men.
and
since
law
cannot
operate
without
the
sanction
and
support
of
a
dominating
force,
this
force
must
be
entrusted
to
those
who
make
the
laws.
there;ll
always
be
the
argument
that
video
games
are
meant
to
be
played
for
fun.
believe
me,
some
of
it;s
a
lot
of
fun.
video
games
are
meant
to
be
played
at
home,
relaxing
on
a
couch
amongst
friends.
and
they
are,
and
that;s
fun.
but
competitive
gaming,
when
you
wanna
attach
your
name
to
a
world
record,
when
you
want
your
name
written
into
history,
you
have
to
pay
the
price.
therefore
you
should
be
desirous
of
hearing
patiently
the
opinions
of
others,
and
consider
and
reflect
carefully
whether
or
no
he
who
censures
you
has
reason
for
his
censure;
and
correct
your
work
if
you
find
that
he
is
right,
but
if
not,
then
let
it
seem
that
you
have
not
understood
him,
or
-
in
case
he
is
a
man
whom
you
esteem
-
show
him
by
argument
why
it
is
that
he
is
mistaken.
i;ve
thought
about
this
a
lot.
if
we;re
together
this
is
what;s
going
to
happen.
i;m
going
to
keep
pursuing
what
i;m
pursuing,
and
it;s
going
to
take
up
more
and
more
of
my
time.
you;re
going
to
see
me
less
and
less.
when
you
do,
i;ll
be
distracted,
i;ll
be
upset,
i;ll
be
playing
things
in
my
mind.
and
you;re
going
to
just
grow
to
resent
me.
at
a
certain
point,
you;ll
tell
me
to
ease
up
on
the
drumming,
to
spend
more
time
with
you.
and
i
won;t
be
able
to.
and
i;ll
start
to
resent
you
for
even
asking
me
that.
i;ll
feel
like
you;re
dragging
me
down,
you;ll
feel
like
you
don;t
matter
-
and
before
long,
we;ll
hate
each
other.
so
i
think
we
should
just
cut
it
off
now,
cleanly,
for
those
reasons.
tommy
had
felt
alone
in
a
crowd
before,
even
inferior
to
everyone
in
a
crowd,
but
now
he
felt,
well,
different.
it
wasn;t
just
the
clothes
and
the
make
up,
it
was
the
humanity.
he
wasn;t
part
of
it.
heightened
senses
or
not,
he
felt
like
he
had
his
nose
pressed
against
the
window,
looking
in.
the
problem
was,
it
was
the
window
of
a
donut
shop.
if
i
had
had
the
power
to
prevent
my
own
birth
i
should
certainly
never
have
consented
to
accept
existence
under
such
ridiculous
conditions.
are
you
telling
me
that
not
only
did
you
invent
a
secret
plan
to
fight
inflation
but
now
you
don;t
support
it?
what
we
do
know
is
that,
as
the
chemical
window
closed,
another
awakening
took
place;
that
the
human
spirit
is
more
powerful
than
any
drug
-
and
that
is
what
needs
to
be
nourished:
with
work,
play,
friendship,
family.
these
are
the
things
that
matter.
this
is
what
we;d
forgotten
-
the
simplest
things.
we
may
never
know
who
killed
paige.
but
this
isn;t
about
you
not
going
to
jail
for
paige;s
murder,
this
is
about
you
not
living
a
lie.
not
hiding.
this
is
about
you
standing
up
and
being
who
you
are.
that;s
honorable,
that;s
brave,
that;s
heroic,
and
that;s
who
you
are,
sully.
you;re
a
hero.
you
fought
a
war
and
you
were
braver
than
i
can
ever
imagine
being.
this
is
just
another
war
-
for
every
gay
person
who
ever
wore
a
uniform.
be
brave
now.
finally,
sparing
neither
labor
nor
expense,
i
succeeded
in
constructing
for
myself
so
excellent
an
instrument
that
objects
seen
by
means
of
it
appeared
nearly
one
thousand
times
larger
and
over
thirty
times
closer
than
when
regarded
with
our
natural
vision.
we
frequently
pass
so
near
to
happiness
without
seeing,
without
regarding
it,
or
if
we
do
see
and
regard
it,
yet
without
recognizing
it.
klausner
sat
down
beside
the
telephone
and
waited.
he
tried
to
remember
what
the
shriek
of
the
tree
had
sounded
like,
but
he
couldn;t.
he
could
remember
only
that
it
had
been
enormous
and
frightful
and
that
it
had
made
him
feel
sick
with
horror.
he
tried
to
imagine
what
sort
of
noise
a
human
would
make
if
he
had
to
stand
anchored
to
the
ground
while
someone
deliberately
swung
a
small
sharp
thing
at
his
leg
so
that
the
blade
cut
in
deep
and
wedged
itself
in
the
cut.
same
sort
of
noise
perhaps?
the
morning
sun
in
all
its
glory
greets
the
day
with
hope
and
comfort
too.
and
you
fill
my
life
with
laughter,
you
can
make
it
better.
really
knowing
is
good.
not
knowing,
or
refusing
to
know,
is
bad,
or
amoral,
at
least.
you
can;t
act
if
you
don;t
know.
acting
without
knowing
takes
you
right
off
the
cliff.
well,
i
guess
the
gentlemen
are
in
a
pretty
tall
hurry
to
get
me
out
of
here.
the
way
the
evidence
has
piled
up
against
me,
i
can;t
say
i
blame
them
much.
and
i;m
quite
willing
to
go,
sir,
when
they
vote
it
that
way
but
before
that
happens
i;ve
got
a
few
things
i
want
to
say
to
this
body.
i
tried
to
say
them
once
before
and
i
got
stopped
colder
than
a
mackerel.
well,
i;d
like
to
get
them
said
this
time,
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i;m
not
going
to
leave
this
body
until
i
do
get
them
said.
i
can
lead
with
pride,
i
can
make
us
strong.
i;ll
be
satisfied
if
i
play
along,
but
the
voice
inside
sings
a
different
song.
what
is
wrong
with
me?
see
the
light
as
it
shines
on
the
sea,
it;s
blinding.
but
no
one
knows
how
deep
it
goes.
and
it
seems
like
it;s
calling
out
to
me,
so
come
find
me,
and
let
me
know
what;s
beyond
that
line.
when
will
i
cross
that
line?
the
line
where
the
sky
meets
the
sea,
it
calls
me.
and
no
one
knows
how
far
it
goes.
if
the
wind
in
my
sail
on
the
sea
stays
behind
me,
one
day
i;ll
know
how
far
i;ll
go.
opening
your
eyes
is
all
that
is
needing.
the
heart
lies
and
the
head
plays
tricks
with
us,
but
the
eyes
see
true.
look
with
your
eyes.
hear
with
your
ears.
taste
with
your
mouth.
smell
with
your
nose.
feel
with
your
skin.
then
comes
the
thinking,
afterward,
and
in
that
way
knowing
the
truth.
there;s
no
such
thing
as
a
painless
lesson,
they
just
don;t
exist.
sacrifices
are
necessary.
you
can;t
gain
anything
without
losing
something
first.
although
if
you
can
endure
that
pain
and
walk
away
from
it,
you;ll
find
that
you
now
have
a
heart
strong
enough
to
overcome
any
obstacle.
yeah...
a
heart
made
fullmetal.
i
can;t
perform
under
pressure.
that;s
why
i
never
play
anything
for
money,
i
choke.
i
could
choke
tonight.
and
she
works
in
my
office,
can
you
imagine?
she
goes
around
telling
everyone
what
happened?
maybe
i
should
cancel,
i
have
a
very
bad
feeling
about
this.
on
some
shelf
in
some
hexagon,
it
was
argued,
there
must
exist
a
book
that
is
the
cipher
and
perfect
compendium
of
all
other
books,
and
some
librarian
must
have
examined
that
book;
this
librarian
is
analogous
to
a
god.
i
was
trying
to
feel
some
kind
of
good-bye.
i
mean
i;ve
left
schools
and
places
i
didn;t
even
know
i
was
leaving
them.
i
hate
that.
i
don;t
care
if
it;s
a
sad
good-bye
or
a
bad
good-bye,
but
when
i
leave
a
place
i
like
to
know
i;m
leaving
it.
if
you
don;t
you
feel
even
worse.
we
sit
silently
and
watch
the
world
around
us.
this
has
taken
us
a
lifetime
to
learn.
it
seems
only
the
old
are
able
to
sit
next
to
one
another
and
not
say
anything
and
still
feel
content.
the
young,
brash
and
impatient,
must
always
break
the
silence.
it
is
a
waste,
for
silence
is
pure.
silence
is
holy.
it
draws
people
together
because
only
those
who
are
comfortable
with
each
other
can
sit
without
speaking.
this
is
the
great
paradox.
he
rode
past
me
and
kept
on
goin;.
never
said
nothin;
goin;
by.
he
just
rode
on
past
and
he
had
his
blanket
wrapped
around
him
and
his
head
down.
and
when
he
rode
past
i
seen
he
was
carryin;
fire
in
a
horn
the
way
people
used
to
do
and
i
could
see
the
horn
from
the
light
inside
of
it.
about
the
color
of
the
moon.
and
in
the
dream
i
knew
that
he
was
goin;
on
ahead
and
that
he
was
fixin;
to
make
a
fire
somewhere
out
there
in
all
that
dark
and
all
that
cold,
and
i
knew
that
whenever
i
got
there
he
would
be
there.
out
there
up
ahead.
pork

in

after
being
heated
during

it

everybody

in
the
end,
life

are
about

about

is
easy.

to
come
with

to

two
of

he
can

i
just
heard
it
as
you

have
heard
it
and
that;s
not
good.
let
me
start
again.
i;m
a
paleontologist,
you;ll
be
there
with
us
and
the
touching
refers
only
to
bones
-
fossils!
seeing
someone
lose
it
like
that.
you
know,
it
reminded
me
of
how
i
feel
sometimes.
like
i;m
on
the
verge
of
just
blowing
up.
all
the
stress
and
pressure
and
anxiety
just
bubbling
up.
but
i;m
never
able
to
let
it
out
like
that.
you
know,
i
just
keep
it
inside.
your
problem
is
you
spent
your
whole
life
thinking
there
are
rules.
there
aren;t.
we
used
to
be
gorillas.
all
we
had
is
what
we
could
take
and
defend.
the
truth
is,
you;re
more
of
a
man
today
than
you
were
yesterday.
and
i
have
one
of
those
very
loud,
stupid
laughs.
i
mean
if
i
ever
sat
behind
myself
in
a
movie
or
something,
i;d
probably
lean
over
and
tell
myself
to
please
shut
up.
there
were
those
of
us
who
fought
against
this.
but
in
the
end,
we
could
not
keep
up
with
the
expense
involved
in
the
arms
race,
the
space
race,
and
the
peace
race.
and
at
the
same
time,
our
people
grumbled
for
more
nylons
and
washing
machines.
our
doomsday
scheme
cost
us
just
a
small
fraction
of
what
we;d
been
spending
on
defense
in
a
single
year.
but
the
deciding
factor
was
when
we
learned
that
your
country
was
working
along
similar
lines,
and
we
were
afraid
of
a
doomsday
gap.
you
been
confusing
since
the
day
i
met
you.
another
night
chasing,
this
feels
like
home.
since
i;ve
been
miles
away,
no
change.
outsider
inside
looking
dazed.
just
wash
the
glitter
off
your
face
and
go
home.
well
then,
from
out
of
nowhere,
a
huge
tidal
wave
lifted
me,
tossed
me
like
a
cork,
and
i
found
myself
right
on
top
of
him
-
face
to
face
with
the
blowhole.
i
could
barely
see
from
the
waves
crashing
down
upon
me,
but
i
knew
something
was
there.
so
i
reached
my
hand
in,
felt
around,
and
pulled
out
the
obstruction.
today
you
are
you,
that
is
truer
than
true.
there
is
no
one
alive
who
is
youer
than
you.
if
i
lay
here,
if
i
just
lay
here,
would
you
lie
with
me
and
just
forget
the
world?
to
win
back
my
youth,
there
is
nothing
i
wouldn;t
do
-
except
take
exercise,
get
up
early,
or
be
a
useful
member
of
the
community.
don;t
let
us
forget
that
the
causes
of
human
actions
are
usually
immeasurably
more
complex
and
varied
than
our
subsequent
explanations
of
them.
you
are
too
concerned
with
what
was
and
what
will
be.
there
is
a
saying:
yesterday
is
history,
tomorrow
is
a
mystery,
but
today
is
a
gift.
that
is
why
it
is
called
the
present.
well,
the
problem
is,
it;s
not
easy
for
me
to
think
of
ways
to
improve
myself,
because
i;m
pretty
much
one
of
the
best
people
i
know.
well,
it
just
so
happens,
this
hacienda
comes
with
its
very
own
private
beach.
and
this
private
beach
just
so
happens
to
look
particularly
beautiful
bathed
in
moonlight.
and
there
just
so
happens
to
be
a
full
moon
out
tonight.
fly
me
to
the
moon
and
let
me
play
among
the
stars.
let
me
see
what

is
like
on

in

but
since
then,
the

has
made
this
impossible.

the

are
so

too

to

it;s

the

never
tried
to
keep
a

it;s

than
i
would
have

that;s
probably
just
because
it;s

by

you
would

to

if
you
surround

leave
him

escape

he

fine!
well,
you
go
and
have
a
really
good
night;s
sleep
then,
i;m
hoping
to
get
a
couple
hours
later
on
myself
but
i;ll
be
up
in
good
time
to
serve
you
your
breakfast
in

if
you
can
remember
to
sleep
with
your
mouth
open
you
won;t
even
have
to

up,
i;ll
just
drop
in

you;re

that
doesn;t

think
if
your
clients
want
to
sit
on
my
shoulders
and
call
themselves
tall,
they
have
the
right
to
give
it
a
try.
but
there;s
no
requirement
that
i
enjoy
sitting
here
listening
to
people
lie.
you
have

of
my

you
have
the
minimum

the

of
my

is

my

and
i
are
doing

no

in

and

there
was
only
one
catch
and
that
was
catch-22,
which
specified
that
a
concern

that
were

was
the

all
he
had
to
do
was

and
as
soon
as
he
did,
he
would
no
longer
be
crazy
and
would
have
to
fly
more

i;ve
taken
my
bows
and
my
curtain
calls.
you
brought
me
fame
and
fortune,
and
everything
that
goes
with
it.
i
thank
you
all.
but
it;s
been
no
bed
of
roses,
no
pleasure

i
consider
it
a
challenge
before
the
whole
human
race,
and
i
ain;t
gonna
lose.

don;t
want

i
need

to

and
since
you
got
more
feet
on

than

on

i;d
like
you
to
assist.
i;ll
leave
you
a

there;s

consumed
by
the
fire

his

they
pierce

valerie,
this
isn;t
how
our
story
had
to
be.
oh
valerie,
thought
you;d
always
be
a

me.
i
don;t

if
you

i
still
think
about
you,
oh...
if
you;re
ever
coming
home
-
i
miss
you
so.

is
when
you
look
into

eyes
and
suddenly
you
go
all
the
way

to
their
soul,
and
you
both
know

i
always
imagined
i;d
fall
in

nursing
a
blind
soldier
who
was
wounded
in
battle.
or
maybe
while
rescuing
someone
in
the
middle
of
a
blizzard,
seconds
before
the
avalanche
hits.
i
thought
at
least
by
the
age
of
fifteen
i;d
have
a
love
life,
but
i
don;t
even
have
a
like
life!
it
is
something
to
be
able
to
paint
a
particular
picture,
or
to
carve
a
statue,
and
so
to
make
a
few
objects
beautiful;
but
it
is
far
more
glorious
to
carve
and
paint

very
atmosphere
and

through
which
we
look,
which
morally
we
can

i
appreciate
but
can;t
accept
this
thank
you
note
that;s
sealed
with
your
last
breath,
and
i
won;t
stand
aside
and
listen
to
you
give
up.
what
were
you
thinking,
telling
me
to
change
my
game?
this
star
wasn;t
going
anywhere,
it
was
kaput!
don;t
you
see
what
i;ve
done
with
this
place,
with
this
whole
thing?
don;t
you
see
that
i;ve
changed
the
game?
no,
i
am
the
game!
before
i
knew
where
this
was
going,
i
would;ve
listened
to
you.
right
now
i
distance
myself
from
whatever
you
have
to
say.
i;ve
made
this
something
way
bigger
than
you
are
ever
gonna
be.
i
made
it
this
far,
and
i;m
taking
it
to
the
top.
that;s
great
rachel,
but
i;m
on
my
third
glass
of
chardonnay
and
i
don;t
think
you
called
me
over
here
to
tell
me
you
submitted
your
application
to
the
bar,
or
that
you;re
putting
your
foot
down
with
louis.
as
you
know
the
concept
of
the
suction
pump
is
centuries
old.
really
that;s
all
this
is
except
that
instead
of
sucking
water
i;m
sucking
life.
i;ve
just
sucked
one
year
of
your
life
away.
i
might
one
day
go
as
high
as
five
but
i
really
don;t
know
what
that
would
do
to
you.
so
let;s
just
start
with
what
we
have.
what
did
this
do
to
you?
tell
me.
and
remember,
this
is
for
posterity
so
be
honest.
how
do
you
feel?
winning?
is
that
what
you
think
it;s
about?
i;m
not
trying
to
win.
i;m
not
doing
this
because
i
want
to
beat
someone,
or
because
i
hate
someone,
or
because
i
want
to
blame
someone.
it;s
not
because
it;s
fun,
god
knows
it;s
not
because
it;s
easy,
and
it;s
not
even
because
it
works,
because
it
hardly
ever
does.
i
do
what
i
do
because
it;s
right.
because
it;s
decent.
and
above
all,
it;s
kind.
it;s
just
that.
just
kind.
if
i
run
away
today,
good
people
will
die.
if
i
stand
and
fight,
some
of
them
might
live.
maybe
not
many,
maybe
not
for
long.
hey,
you
know,
maybe
there;s
no
point
in
any
of
this
at
all,
but
it;s
the
best
i
can
do,
so
i;m
going
to
do
it,
and
i
will
stand
here
doing
it
until
it
kills
me,
and
you;re
going
to
die,
too.
someday.
i
can
and
do
say
that
nothing
human
beings
have
ever
before
attempted
in
the
entire
nutty
history
of
the
race
even
approaches
this
in
absolute
fascination.
when
i
first
understood
what
this
project
is
about
i
didn;t
sleep
for
two
nights,
and
i
don;t
mean
in
the
usual
way;
i
mean
i
literally
did
not
sleep.
we
live
in
an
age
when
people
do
more
writing
than
they
have
at
any
other
time
in
history.
not
only
have
computers
made
it
easier
to
produce
clean
texts,
but
they;ve
also
allowed
average
writers
to
create
documents
that
twenty
years
ago
would
have
required
professional
designers.
open
to
everything
happy
and
sad,
seeing
the
good
when
it;s
all
going
bad.

the
sun

i
can;t
really
see,
hoping
the
sun
will
at
least
look
at
me.

on
everything

all
that
i
needed
i
never
could

hold
on
to
people
-
they;re
slipping
away.
hold
on
to
this
while
it;s
slipping
away.
first
time
we
had
dinner,
you
asked
me
what
i
wanted
from
you.
and
the
first
time
we
kissed,
i
realized
that
i
don;t
want
anything...
except
you.
and
now
i;m
asking
if
you;ll
go
on
one
more
adventure
with
me.
sara
ellis,
will
you
marry
me?
you
like
boats
but
not
the
ocean.
you
go
to
a
lake
in
the
summer
with
your
family
up
in
the
mountains.
there;s
a
long
wooden
dock
and
a
boathouse
with
boards
missing
from
the
roof
and
a
place
you
used
to
crawl
underneath
to
be
alone.
you;re
a
sucker
for
french
poetry
and
rhinestones.
you;re
very
generous.
you;re
kind
to
strangers
and
children
and
when
you
stand
in
the
snow
you
look
like
an
angel.
on
the
contrary,
it
may
happen
that
the
atoms
are
launched
in
a
rather
disorderly
manner.
if
so,
most
of
the
meetings
will
be
uninteresting
ones;
but
on
the
other
hand,
as
in
a
kind
of
lottery,
that
disorder
can
be
highly
valuable,
because
the
few
meetings
which
are
useful,
being
of
an
exceptional
nature
and
between
seemingly
very
remote
ideas,
will
probably
be
the
most
important
ones.
the
jagged
mountains
were
pure
blue
in
the
dawn
and
everywhere
birds
twittered
and
the
sun
when
it
rose
caught
the
moon
in
the
west
so
that
they
lay
opposed
to
each
other
across
the
earth,
the
sun
whitehot
and
the
moon
a
pale
replica,
as
if
they
were
the
ends
of
a
common
bore
beyond
whose
terminals
burned
worlds
past
all
reckoning.
as
the
riders
came
up
through
the
mesquite
and
pyracantha
single
file
in
a
light
clank
of
arms
and
chink
of
bitrings
the
sun
climbed
and
the
moon
set
and
the
horses
and
the
dewsoaked
mules
commenced
to
steam
in
flesh
and
in
shadow.
take
me
home
to
the
friends
i;ve
always
known.
take
me
home,
back
to
the
place
where
i
belong.
a
distant
coast
line,
what
peaks
insight,
washing
the
white
of
that
ocean;s
tide.
a
mortal,
frodo,
who
keeps
one
of
the
great
rings,
does
not
die,
but
he
does
not
grow
or
obtain
more
life,
he
merely
continues,
until
at
last
every
minute
is
a
weariness.
and
if
he
often
uses
the
ring
to
make
himself
invisible,
he
fades:
he
becomes
in
the
end
invisible
permanently,
and
walks
in
the
twilight
under
the
eye
of
the
dark
power
that
rules
the
rings.
and
as
we
let
our
own
light
shine,
we
unconsciously
give
other
people
permission
to
do
the
same.
as
we
are
liberated
from
our
own
fear,
our
presence
automatically
liberates
others.
for
once
i
can
touch
what
my
heart
used
to
dream
of
long
before
i
knew
someone
warm
like
you
would
make
my
dreams
come
true.
i
hear
you;re
buying
a
synthesizer
and
an
arpeggiator
and
are
throwing
your
computer
out
the
window
because
you
want
to
make
something
real.
you
want
to
make
a
yaz
record.
i
hear
that
you
and
your
band
have
sold
your
guitars
and
bought
turntables.
i
hear
that
you
and
your
band
have
sold
your
turntables
and
bought
guitars.
i
hear
everybody
that
you
know
is
more
relevant
than
everybody
that
i
know.
i
am
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world.
perhaps
other
people
have
said
so
before,
but
not
one
with
such
justice.
i
am
happier
even
than
jane;
she
only
smiles,
i
laugh.
you;re
telling
us
you
killed
those
three
young
men
on
the
subway?
and
why
should
we
believe
you?
i;ve
got
nothing
left
to
lose,
nothing
can
hurt
me
anymore.
my
life,
is
nothing
but
a
comedy.
let
me
get
this
straight,
you
think
killing
those
guys
is
funny.
i
do,
and
i;m
tired
of
pretending
it;s
not.
comedy
is
subjective
murray,
isn;t
that
what
they
say.
all
of
you,
this
system
that
knows
so
much,
you
decide
what;s
right
or
wrong.
the
same
way
that
you
decide
what;s
funny,
or
not.
so
i
go
about
my
day
as
normal.
but
i
can;t
seem
to
pass
it
off
as
just
a
random
event.
it
consumes
me.
i
thought
i
was
moving
on,
but
i
guess
i
was
just
switching
off.
and
now
i
see
my
life
as
the
banal
slog
it
instantly
became.
and
i
don;t
know
if
i
can
go
on
the
same.
but
i
don;t
wanna
dig
up
old
bones.
i
mean,
i
don;t
even
know
if
she
has
the
same
phone
number.
who
knows?
maybe
she
does.
hanging
by
threads
of
palest
silver,
i
could
have
stayed
that
way
forever.
bad
blood
and
ghosts
wrapped
tight
around
me,
nothing
could
ever
seem
to
touch
me.
i
lose
what
i
love
most;
did
you
know
i
was
lost
until
you
found
me?
look
at
the
night
and
it
don;t
seem
so
lonely.
we
filled
it
up
with
only
two,
and
when
i
hurt,
hurting
runs
off
my
shoulder.
how
can
i
hurt
when
i;m
holding
you?
come
to
me
now
and
rest
your
head
for
just
five
minutes,
everything
is
good.
such
a
cozy
room,
the
windows
are
illuminated
by
the
evening,
sunshine
through
them,

gems
for
you,

for
you.
works
of
art
participate
in
our
lives;
we
are
not
just
distant
observers
of
their
lives.
they
are
in
conversation
among
themselves
and
with
us.
so
when
you
find
yourself
locked
onto
an
unpleasant
train
of
thought,
heading
for
the
places
in
your
past
where
the
screaming
is
unbearable,
remember
there;s
always
madness.
madness
is
the
emergency
exit.
i
will
not
vanish,
you
will
not
scare
me.
try
to
get
through
it,
try
to
push
through
it.
you
were
not
thinking
that
i
will
not
do
it.
they
be
lovin;
someone
and
i;m
another
story.
take
the
next
ticket,
get
the
next
train.
why
would
i
do
it?
anyone;d
think
that.
i
open
up
the
paper.
there;s
a
story
of
an
actor
who
had
died
while
he
was
drinking.
he
was
no
one
i
had
heard
of.
and
i;m
turning
to
the
horoscope
and
looking
for
the
funnies
when
i;m
feeling
someone
watching
me.
with
all
due
respect
ma;am,
i;m
done
wasting
my
breath
on
you,
because
the
purpose
of
this
hearing
was
to
determine
if
mike
ross
had
reformed.
but
you
don;t
seem
to
be
interested
in
that
because
you;ve
already
made
your
mind
up.
the
explosion
would
be
just
the
right
size
to
maximize
the
amount
of
paperwork
your
lab
would
face.
if
the
explosion
were
smaller,
you
could
potentially
cover
it
up.
if
it
were
larger,
there
would
be
no
one
left
in
the
city
to
submit
paperwork
to.
i
have
to
disagree.
i
make
good
life
choices.
mostly
because
they;re
forced
on
me,
but
i
make
them.
and
i
find
myself
in
unpleasant
situations
all
the
time.
you
know
why?
because
even
if
you
have
a
choice
it
can
and
will
be
taken
away
from
you.
he
also
swore
himself
by
a
binding
oath
that
whatever
wife
he
married
he
would
abate
her
maidenhead
at
night
and
slay
her
next
morning
to
make
sure
of
his
honour.
now
if
you
choose
not
to
respond
to
my
parental
authority
i
should
warn
you
i
have
mind-altering
drugs
in
the
other
room
and
i;m
not
afraid
to
use
them.
for
years
i;ve
been
rushing
around,
taking
whatever
i
fancied,
not
giving
a
tinker;s
curse
for
those
i
hurt.
yet
here
i
am...
with
riches
and
reputation,
feeling
no
wiser
than
when
i
left
home.
yet
when
i
turn
around,
and
look
at
the
course
i;ve
run...
there;s
not
a
man
or
woman
that
i
love
left
standing
beside
me.
in
one
small
part
of
space,
the
war
continues.
in
war,
there
can
be
only
one
victor.
space
is
an
uninhabited
wilderness
and
bloody
wounds
disappear
with
time.
maybe
the
multitude
of
stars
in
the
sky
remember
those
wounds.
maybe
it
is
fated
that
even
those
stars
will
vanish
one
day.
man;s
presence
in
the
midst
of
these
stars
is
all
that
remains
of
a
forgotten
battle.
he;d
been
terrified
of
dying
his
entire
life,
and
as
much
as
he
tried
not
to
think
about
it,
death
was
always
in
the
back
of
his
head,
around
every
corner,
and
hovering
on
each
horizon.
he;d
brushed
shoulders
with
death
on
a
few
occasions,
but
in
his
carefree
youth,
it
had
almost
seemed
like
an
abstract,
impossible
thing
to
ever
happen
to
him.
but
with
each
passing
decade,
he
began
to
gauge
the
time
he
probably
had
left,
and
by
his
40s
-
what
he
considered
his
halfway
point
at
best
-
he
had
come
to
know
just
one
thing:
you
will
only
get
older.
the
next
thing
you
know,
you;re
looking
back
instead
of
forward.
if
this
had
been
an
old
house,
with
creaking
wood,
and
dark
shadows,
and
heavily
panelled
walls,
there
might
have
been
an
eerie
feeling.
but
this
house
was
the
essence
of
modernity.
there
were
no
dark
corners
-
no
possible
sliding
panels
-
it
was
flooded
with
electric
light
-
everything
was
new
and
bright
and
shining.
there
was
nothing
hidden
in
this
house,
nothing
concealed.
it
had
no
atmosphere
about
it.
somehow,
that
was
the
most
frightening
thing
of
all...
he
didn;t
know
if
that
was
really
true
or
not,
but
he
discovered
something
which
was
tremendously
liberating:
he
didn;t
care.
he
was
very
tired
of
thinking
and
thinking
and
still
not
knowing.
he
was
also
tired
of
being
frightened,
like
a
man
who
has
entered
a
cave
on
a
lark
and
now
begins
to
suspect
he
is
lost.
stop
thinking
about
it,
then.
that;s
the
solution.
but
maybe
this
isn;t
the
end
of
the
road,
maybe
it;s
a
stop-off,
a
moment
to
reflect
before
moving
on.
because
that;s
how
we
honor
those
we;ve
lost:
by
looking
forward,
not
back.
you
see,
this
is
one
of
those
stories
with
a
moral.
and
the
moral
is
simply
this:
life
persists.
it
wasn;t
that
i
had
anything
against
the
movies,
but
they
had
never
been
very
important
to
me,
and
not
once
in
more
than
fifteen
years
of
teaching
and
writing
had
i
felt
the
urge
to
talk
about
them.
i
liked
them
as
everyone
else
did
-
as
diversions,
as
animated
wallpaper,
as
fluff.
no
matter
how
beautiful
or
hypnotic
the
images
sometimes
were,
they
never
satisfied
me
as
powerfully
as
words
did.
too
much
was
given,
i
felt,
not
enough
was
left
to
the
viewer;s
imagination,
and
the
paradox
was
that
the
closer
movies
came
to
simulating
reality,
the
worse
they
failed
at
representing
the
world
-
which
is
in
us
as
much
as
it
is
around
us.
there
was
a
time
not
that
long
ago
when
many
drivers
thought
nothing
of
tossing
empty
bottles
out
the
windows
of
their
cars.
years
later,
these
same
citizens
came
to
realize
that
littering
was
not
an
acceptable
way
to
dispose
of
their
trash.
the
web
design
community
is
now
undergoing
a
similar
shift
in
attitude,
and
web
standards
are
key
to
this
transformation.

at

the
way
all
women
want
to
be
looked
at
by

too
many
times
we
stand
aside
and
let
the
waters
slip
away
;til
what
we
put
off
;til

now
become
today.

upon
the

i
hadn;t
seen
anything
so
beautiful
in
my
life.
she
was
like
an
angel.
i
just
sat
next
to
her
on
that
bus
and
had
a
conversation
all
the
way
to
school.
next
to
mamma
no
one
ever
talked
to
me
or
asked
me
questions.
from
that
day
on
we
were
always
together.
jenny,
she
helped
me
learn
how
to
read
and
i
showed
her
how
to
swing.
sometimes
we;d
just
sit
out
and
wait
for
the
stars.
for
some
reason
jenny
never
wanted
to
go
home
she
was
my
most
special
friend,
my
only
friend.
heaven,
i;m
in
heaven,
and
my
heart
beats
so
that
i
can
hardly
speak,
and
i
seem
to
find
the
happiness
i
seek
when
we;re
out
together
dancing,
cheek
to
cheek.
heaven,
i;m
in
heaven,
and
the
cares
that
hang
around
me
through
the
week
seem
to
vanish
like
a
gambler;s
lucky
streak
when
we;re
out
together
dancing,
cheek
to
cheek.
punishment
and
negative
reinforcement
are
opposites.
punishment
is
when
something
bad
happens
to
you
because
of
something
you
did;
negative
reinforcement
is
when
something
bad
stops
happening
to
you,
or
doesn;t
start
happening
to
you
in
the
first
place,
because
of
something
you
did.
punishment
is
bad,
and
negative
reinforcement
is
good.

there
is

if
you;re
on

eat
from

with
no

-
or
even
better,
from

man,
do
not
pride
yourself
on
your
superiority
to
the
animals,
for
they
are
without
sin,
while
you,
with
all
your
greatness,
you
defile
the
earth
wherever
you
appear
and
leave
an
ignoble
trail
behind
you
-
and
that
is
true,
alas,
for
almost
every
one
of
us!
for
the
same
reasons
that
scientific
standards
change
within
each
of
the
natural
sciences,
they
differ
extensively
between
them
and
across
the
divide
between
natural
and
social

indeed
the
differences
between

in
the
natural

social

must
be
wider
than
the

in
the
middle
of
our
life
journey
i
found
myself
in
a
dark
wood.
i
had
wandered
from
the
straight
path.
it
isn;t
easy
to
talk
about
it:
it
was
such
a
thick,
wild,
and
rough
forest
that
when
i
think
of
it
my
fear
returns.
if
one
has
only
one
good
memory
left
in
one;s
heart,
that
may
sometime
be
the
means
of
saving

harry,
i
have
no
idea
where
this
will
lead
us,
but
i
have
a
definite
feeling
it
will
be
a
place
both
wonderful
and
strange.
before
time
began,
there
was
the
cube.
we
know
not
where
it
comes
from,
only
that
it
holds
the
power
to
create
worlds
and
fill
them
with
life.
that
is
how
our
race
was
born.
for
a
time
we
lived
in
harmony,
but
like
all
great
power,
some
wanted
it
for
good,
others
for
evil.
and
so
began
the
war.
a
war
that
ravaged
our
planet
until
it
was
consumed
by
death,
and
the
cube
was
lost
to
the
far
reaches
of
space.
we
scattered
across
the
galaxy,
hoping
to
find
and
rebuild
our
home.
searching
every
star,
every
world.
and
just
when
all
hope
seemed
lost,
message
of
a
new
discovery
drew
us
to
an
unknown
planet
called...
earth.
but
we
were
already
too
late.
so
it
was
that
over
the
course
of
time,
the
man
and
the
weapon
seemed
as
one.
ashbringer
became
a
name
of
legend,
attributed
not
just
to
the
fearsome
blade
but
also
to
the
relentless
knight
who
wielded
it.
mom
says
each
of
us
has
a
veil
between
ourselves
and
the
rest
of
the
world,
like
a
bride
wears
on
her
wedding
day,
except
this
kind
of
veil
is
invisible.
we
walk
around
happily
with
these
invisible
veils
hanging
down
over
our
faces.
the
world
is
kind
of
blurry,
and
we
like
it
that
way.
but
sometimes
our
veils
are
pushed
away
for
a
few
moments,
like
there;s
a
wind
blowing
it
from
our
faces.
and
when
the
veil
lifts,
we
can
see
the
world
as
it
really
is,
just
for
those
few
seconds
before
it
settles
down
again.
wise
men

only
fools

i
can;t

i

it
be
a
sin
if
i
can;t

falling
in

with

let
us
imagine
that
you
are
in
a
race
with
a
tortoise.
the
tortoise
has
a
ten-yard
head
start.
in
the
time
it
takes
you
to
run
that
ten
yards,
the
tortoise
has
moved
one
yard.
and
then
in
the
time
it
takes
you
to
make
up
that
distance,
the
tortoise
goes
a
bit
farther,
and
so
on
forever.
you
are
faster
than
the
tortoise
but
you
can
never
catch
him;
you
can
only
decrease
his
lead.
they
told
me
that
you
had
gone
totally
insane,
and
that
your
methods
were

just

we
lost

i
write
jokes
for
a
living,
man.
you
know,
i
sit
in
my
hotel
at
night,
i
think
of
something
that;s
funny,
then
i
go
get
a
pen
and
i
write
it
down.
or,
if
the
pen;s
too
far
away,
i
have
to
convince
myself
that
what
i
thought
of
ain;t
funny.

the

oh...
and
how
is
education
supposed
to
make
me

smarter?
besides,
every
time
i

something

it

some
old
stuff
out

i

i;ve

i

in

and
getting
a
record
in

i
haven;t
heard
about
that
yet.
maybe
he
did
that
25
years
ago.
but
i
haven;t
heard
of
him
doing
it
lately,
and
it
makes
you
wonder
why
not.
i
know.
i;m
trying
to
save
him
by
avoiding
him
so
i
could
be
with
him.
but
i
can;t
go
near
him
or
i;ll
destroy
him.
so
if
i
could
just
manage
to
stay
away
from
him
then
maybe
we
could
be
together.

don;t

that

my
curiosity,

it
was
far
from

were
many
things
i
needed

through
on

things
that

are
poor

subject
to

rather
than
what

i
know
where
you;re
at,
i
bet
she;s
around.
and
yeah
i
know
it;s
stupid,
but
i
just
gotta
see
it
for
myself.
for
this
is
what
it
means
to
be

to
be

desperate

and

in
every
desperate
retreat,
and
when
there;s
hunger
in
the
land
(as
must
be
now
and
then
in

years)
to
wear
finer
clothes
and
laugh
louder
over
a
scantier

than
any

of

now,
i;m

talking
about
lowering
our

i;m
talking
about
targeting
our
ambitions
correctly.
when
you
look
for
it,
there
is
nothing
to

when
you
listen
for
it,
there
is
nothing
to

when
you
use
it,
it
is
inexhaustible.
it
was
hard
to
toss
things
i
had
once
thought
were
valuable
enough
to
spend
money
on
and
just
as
hard
to
separate
myself
from
worn
and
ragged
clothing
i
had
for
sentimental
reasons.
the
first
ten
minutes
of
sorting
through
clothing
was
like
choosing
which
child
of
mine
should
live
or
die.
once
i;d
passed
through
the
first
few
tough
decisions,
though,
the
momentum
had
been
built
and

was

up

there
was
the
sound
of
slamming
doors
and
raised
voices
before
i
heard
footsteps
running
back
across
the
yard
and
excited
voices
coming
closer.

heads
appeared
at

to

your
style
will
always
creep
in.
but
turn
the
signature
upside
down
and
it
becomes
nothing
more
than
a
drawing.
all
you
have
to
do
is
copy
the
lines.
the
preconceptions
about
letters
go
away
and
you
have
a
perfect
signature.

i
believe
virtually
everything
i
read
and
i
think
that
is
what
makes
me
more
of
a

human
than

who
doesn;t
believe
anything.
it
is
indeed
true
that,
in

to
the
exhilaration
which
the
discoveries
of
the
physical
sciences
tend
to
produce,
the
insights
which
we
gain
from
the
study
of
society
more
often
have
a
dampening
effect
on
our
aspirations.
many
students
do
not
realize
the
great
importance
of
definitions
to
mathematics.
this
importance
stems
from
the
need
for
mathematicians
to
communicate
with
each
other.
if
two
people
are
trying
to
communicate
about
some
subject,
they
must
have
the
same
understanding
of
its
technical
terms.
however,
there
is
an
important
structural
weakness.
it
is
impossible
to
define
every
concept.
meanwhile,
let
us
have
a
sip
of
tea.
the
afternoon
glow
is
brightening
the
bamboos,
the
fountains
are
bubbling
with
delight,
the
soughing
of
the
pines
is
heard
in
our
kettle.
let
us
dream
of
evanescence
and
linger
in
the
beautiful
foolishness
of
things.
i;m
out
on
a
date
tonight
in
a
candlelit
restaurant
down
by
the
riverside.
everything;s
going
alright
i
guess,
she
took
down
my
number
and
home
address.
everything
was
going
perfectly
until
it
backfired
at
the
disco,
she
slapped
me
at
the
disco.
if
the
children
don;t
grow
up,
our
bodies
get
bigger
but
our
hearts
get
torn
up.
we;re
just
a
million
little
gods
causing
rain
storms,
turning
every
good
thing
to
rust.
i
guess
we;ll
just
have
to
adjust.
she
seemed
to
know,
to
accept,
to
welcome
her
position,
the
citadel
of
the
family,
the
strong
place
that
could
not
be
taken.
baby,
what;s
it
gonna
hurt
if
they
don;t
know,
makin;
everybody
think
that
we;re
solo.
just
as
long
as
you
know
you
got
me,
and
boy
i
got
ya,
;cause
tonight
i;m
making
deals
with
the
devil,
and
i
know
it;s
gonna
get
me
in
trouble.
just
as
long
as
you
know
you
got
me.
we
use
words
like
honor,
code,
loyalty.
we
use
these
words
as
the
backbone
of
a
life
spent
defending
something.
you
use
them
as
a
punchline.
i
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
to
explain
myself
to
a
man
who
rises
and
sleeps
under
the
blanket
of
the
very
freedom
that
i
provide
and
then
questions
the
manner
in
which
i
provide
it.
i
would
rather
you
just
said
thank
you
and
went
on
your
way.
otherwise,
i
suggest
you
pick
up
a
weapon
and
stand
a
post.
either
way,
i
don;t
give
a
damn
what
you
think
you
are
entitled
to.
it
used
to
be
risky
for
a
scientist
to
assert
that
anything
about
human
behavior
was
innate.
to
back
up
such
claims,
you
had
to
show
that
the
trait
was
hardwired,
unchangeable
by
experience,
and
found
in
all
cultures.
i
am
now
quite
cured
of
seeking
pleasure
in
society,
be
it
country
or
town.
a
sensible
man
ought
to
find
sufficient
company
in
himself.
the
math
is
compelling.
most
of
the
people
in
the
world
are
not
your
customers.
they
haven;t
even
heard
of
you
actually.
and
while
many
of
these
people
are
not
qualified
buyers
or
aren;t
interested
in
buying
your
product,
many
of
them
might
be
-
if
only
they
knew
you
existed,
if
they
could
be
convinced
that
your
offering
is
worth
paying
for.
translating
from
one
language
to
another,
unless
it
is
from
greek
and
latin,
the
queens
of
all
languages,
is
like
looking
at
flemish
tapestries
from
the
wrong
side,
for
although
the
figures
are
visible,
they
are
covered
by
threads
that
obscure
them,
and
cannot
be
seen
with
the
smoothness
and
color
of
the
right
side.
it;s
not
really
a
place;
it;s
a
feeling.

at

i
punch

cares
about
you,
not
what
you
can
do
for
them.

there
through
the
good,

of
it.
they
got
your
back,
even
when
it

that;s

once
more
into
the
fray.
into
the
last
good
fight
i;ll
ever
know.

live
and
die
on
this
day.
an
informed
citizenry
has
to
understand
place,
not
because
place
is
more
important
than
other
kinds
of
knowledge
but
because
it
forms
the
foundation
for
so
much
other
knowledge.
as
it
fades,
i
see
the
truth
-
in
plain
sight,
yet
hidden
all
along.
we
are
all
children
of
blood
and
bone.
all
instruments
of
vengeance
and
virtue.
this
truth
holds
me
close,
rocking
me
like
a
child
in
a
mother;s
arms.
it
binds
me
in
its
love
as
death
swallows
me
in
its
grasp.
with
all
six
stones,
i
could
simply
snap
my
fingers,
they
would
all
cease
to
exist
and
i
call
that...
mercy.
and
then
what?
i
finally
rest,
and
watch
the
sun
rise
on
a
grateful
universe.
the
hardest
choices
require
the
strongest
wills.
i;m
in
the
race
of
life
and
time
passed
by.
i
sit
back
and
i
watch
it,
hands
in
my
pockets.
waves
come
crashing
over
me,
but
i
just
watch
;em.
i
just
watch
;em.
i;m
underwater,
but
i
feel
like
i;m
on
top
of
it.
i;m
at
the
bottom,
but
i
don;t
know
what
the
problem
is.
i;m
in
a
box,
but
i;m
the
one
who
locked
me
in.
i;m
suffocating
and
i;m
running
out
of
oxygen.
people
tend
to
think
that
their
beliefs
are
absolutely
true
-
but
in
reality
these
beliefs
are
true
only
for
them.
life
is
fair.
we
all
get
the
same
nine-month
shake
in
the
box,
and
then
the
dice
roll.
some
people
get
a
run
of
sevens.
some
people,
unfortunately,
get
snake-eyes.
it;s
just
how
the
world
is.
i
don;t
worry.
this
is
all
wrong.
i
don;t
know
what
it
is
but
when
i
kiss
you
it;s
like
i;m
kissing
my
brother.
i
guess
that
doesn;t
make
any
sense,
does
it?
one
just
can;t
imagine
what
prison
is
like
from
outside.
you
think,
well,
there;d
be
lots
of
time
to
think
and
read,
it
wouldn;t
be
too
bad.
but
it
is
too
bad.
it;s
the
slowness
of
time.
i;ll
swear
all
the
clocks
in
the
world
have
gone
centuries
slower
since
i
came
here.
if
a
man;s
wearing
his
pants
on
his
head
or
if
he
says
his
words
backwards
from
time
to
time,
you
know
it;s
all
laid
out
there
for
you.
but
if
he;s
friendly
to
strangers
and
keeps
his
home
spick-and-span,
more
often
than
not
he;s
done
something
even
his
own
ma
couldn;t
forgive.
ah
how
shameless
-
the
way
these
mortals
blame
the
gods.
from
us
alone,
they
say,
come
all
their
miseries,
yes,
but
they
themselves,
with
their
own
reckless
ways,
compound
their
pains
beyond
their
proper
share.
i;ve
paid
my
dues
time
after
time.
i;ve
done
my
sentence
but
committed
no
crime.
and
bad
mistakes,
i;ve
made
a
few.
i;ve
had
my
share
of
sand
kicked
in
my
face,
but
i;ve
come
through.
by
now,
i
assume
you
know
your
father;s
been
accused
of
a
very
serious
crime.
he
told
me
he
was
innocent
and
i
believed
him.
i
worked
with
him
a
long
time.
he;s
no
killer,
neal.
the
man
i
know
can;t
be.
after
he
was
arrested,
your
dad
told
me
that
our
department
is
filled
with
dirty
cops
and
they
set
him
up.
it
is
not
a
man;s
duty,
as
a
matter
of
course,
to
devote
himself
to
the
eradication
of
any,
even
the
most
enormous
wrong;
he
may
still
properly
have
other
concerns
to
engage
him;
but
it
is
his
duty,
at
least,
to
wash
his
hands
of
it,
and,
if
he
gives
it
no
thought
longer,
not
to
give
it
practically
his
support.
fireflies,
a
million
little
pieces,
feeds
the
dying
light,
and
brings
me
back
to
life.
in
your
eyes,
i
see
something
to
believe
in,
your
hands
are
like
a
flame,
your
palms;
the
sweetest
pain.
every
day
i
come
by
your
house
and
i
pick
you
up.
and
we
go
out.
we
have
a
few
drinks,
and
a
few
laughs,
and
it;s
great.
but
you
know
what
the
best
part
of
my
day
is?
for
about
ten
seconds,
from
when
i
pull
up
to
the
curb
and
when
i
get
to
your
door,
;cause
i
think,
maybe
i;ll
get
up
there
and
i;ll
knock
on
the
door
and
you
won;t
be
there.
no
goodbye.
no
see
you
later.
no
nothing.
you
just
left.
i
don;t
know
much,
but
i
know
that.
kings
of
little
kingdoms
fought
together,
and
the
young
sun
shone
like
fire
on
the
red
metal
of
their
new
and
greedy
swords.
there
was
victory
and
defeat;
and
towers
fell,
fortresses
were
burned,
and
flames
went
up
into
the
sky.
gold
was
piled
on
biers
of
dead
kings
and
queens;
and
mounds
covered
them,
and
the
stone
doors
were
shut;
and
the
grass
grew
over
all.
when
one
fib
becomes
due
as
it
were,
you
must
forge
another
to
take
up
the
old
acceptance;
and
so
the
stock
of
your
lies
in
circulation
inevitably
multiplies,
and
the
danger
of
detection
increases
every
day.
races
are
not
won
in
the
first
corner;
however,
they
are
often
lost
there.
it;s
usually
best
to
run
as
quick
as
you
can
for
the
first
few
laps,
then
settle
into
a
comfortable,
consistent
pace
-
all
the
while
ready
to
take
advantage
of
any
opportunity
to
pass.
never
turn
down
an
opportunity
to
pass
-
you
may
not
get
it
again.
i
just
want
to
tell
you
how
i;m
feeling.
gotta
make
you
understand.
never
gonna
give
you
up,
never
gonna
let
you
down,
never
gonna
run
around
and
desert
you.
never
gonna
make
you
cry,
never
gonna
say
goodbye,
never
gonna
tell
a
lie
and
hurt
you.
look
dave,
i
can
see
you;re
really
upset
about
this.
i
honestly
think
you
ought
to
sit
down
calmly,
take
a
stress
pill,
and
think
things
over.
i
know
i;ve
made
some
very
poor
decisions
recently,
but
i
can
give
you
my
complete
assurance
that
my
work
will
be
back
to
normal.
well,
you;ve
cracked
the
sky,
scrapers
fill
the
air,
but
will
you
keep
on
building
higher
till
there;s
no
more
room
up
there?
will
you
make
us
laugh,
will
you
make
us
cry?
will
you
tell
us
when
to
live,
will
you
tell
us
when
to
die?
in
a
town
of
moderate
size,
two
men
lived
in
neighbouring
houses;
but
they
had
not
been
there
very
long
before
one
man
took
such
a
hatred
of
the
other,
and
envied
him
so
bitterly,
that
the
poor
man
determined
to
find
another
home,
hoping
that
when
they
no
longer
met
every
day
his
enemy
would
forget
all
about
him.
so
he
sold
his
house
and
the
little
furniture
it
contained,
and
moved
into
the
capital
of
the
country,
which
was
luckily
at
no
great
distance.
about
half
a
mile
from
this
city
he
bought
a
nice
little
place,
with
a
large
garden
and
a
fair-sized
court,
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
an
old
well.
you
were
the
chosen
one!
it
was
said
that
you
would
destroy
the
sith,
not
join
them.
you
were
to
bring
balance
to
the
force,
not
leave
it
in
darkness.
well,
when
i
came
home
from
school
my
head
started
to
get
really
hot.
so
i
drank
some
cold
water,
but
it
didn;t
do
nothing.
so
i
laid
in
the
bathtub
for
a
while,
but
then
i
realized
that
it
was
my
hair
that
was
making
my
head
hot.
so
i
went
into
my
kitchen
and
i
shaved
it
all
off.
i
don;t
want
anyone
to
see.
i
have
a
dream,
a
fantasy,
to
help
me
through
reality.
and
my
destination
makes
it
worth
the
while,
pushing
through
the
darkness
still
another
mile.
i;ll
tell
you
bedtime
stories,
and
you
pretend
they;re
not
boring.
one
day
we;ll
have
a
house
of
our
very
own
and
we;ll
make
it
our
home.
and
i;ll
do
anything
for
you.
it;s
just
two
little
words.
they;re
gonna
change
my
world.
three
letters,
in
old.
and
i
mean
them
with
all
i
got.
we;re
gonna
say
i
do.
i
can
tell
you
the
license
plate
numbers
of
all
six
cars
outside.
i
can
tell
you
that
our
waitress
is
left-handed
and
the
guy
sitting
up
at
the
counter
weighs
two
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
and
knows
how
to
handle
himself.
i
know
the
best
place
to
look
for
a
gun
is
the
cab
of
the
gray
truck
outside,
and
at
this
altitude,
i
can
run
flat
out
for
a
half
mile
before
my
hands
start
shaking.
now
why
would
i
know
that?
how
can
i
know
that
and
not
know
who
i
am?
it
matters
not
how
strait
the
gate,
how
charged
with
punishments
the
scroll,
i
am
the
master
of
my
fate,
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul.
reading
is
not
a
natural
process;
the
habits
necessary
for
efficient
reading
must
be
learned.
the
habits
and
the
skills
involved
in
effective
reading
should
be
acquired
during
the
initial
period
of
reading
instruction.
she
said
that
she
had
just
joined
up
as
a
new
recruit.
she
said
they
threw
her
in
prison
because
she
refused
to
take
part
in
the
rebellion.
i
gave
her
the
key.
looks
like
she
managed
to
break
out
of
here
though.
i
hope
she;s
okay.
amil
says
he
can;t
read
right
because
the
words
jump
around
and
change
on
him.
papa
thinks
he;s
lying
so
he
doesn;t
have
to
do
his
schoolwork.
but
i
know
he;s
not.
i
see
the
way
he
studies
the
writing,
his
eyes
squinted,
his
face
pinched.
i
see
how
hard
he
tries.
he
even
turns
the
book
upside
down
sometimes,
but
he
says
nothing
helps.
i
think
it;s
because
amil
is
a
little
bit
magical.
his
eyes
turn
everything
into
art.
the
point
is
i
intend
to
undertake
this.
and
i;ll
do
it
with
or
without
you.
so
if
you;re
scared,
if
you
haven;t
got
the
stomach
for
this,
let;s
get
it
out
right
now!
what
is
honor
compared
to
a
woman;s
love?
what
is
duty
against
the
feel
of
a
newborn
son
in
your
arms
or
the
memory
of
a
brother;s
smile?
wind
and
words.
wind
and
words.
the
sun
lay
on
the
grass
and
warmed
it,
and
in
the
shade
under
the
grass
the
insects
moved,
ants
and
ant
lions
to
set
traps
for
them,
grasshoppers
to
jump
into
the
air
and
flick
their
yellow
wings
for
a
second,
sow
bugs
like
little
armadillos,
plodding
restlessly
on
many
tender
feet.
you
cannot
defeat
me
with
a
blade
that
does
not
sparkle
with
the
power
to
repel
evil!
what
you
hold
is
useless.
go
back
to
the
world
below,
and
tell
that
to
the
pathetic
fools
who
made
this
blade!
its
power
is
gone,
and
its
edges
are
dull!
it;s
true!
yes,
i
have
been
ill,
very
ill.
but
why
do
you
say
that
i
have
lost
control
of
my
mind,
why
do
you
say
that
i
am
mad?
can
you
not
see
that
i
have
full
control
of
my
mind?
indeed,
the
illness
only
made
my
mind,
my
feelings,
my
senses
stronger,
more
powerful.
listen,
where
i;m
from
there;s
a
saying,
"three
heads
are
better
than
one."
wait,
is
it
two
heads?
whatever,
the
point
is,
three
heads,
thinking
together
are
harder
to
break
than
only
one
arrow.
it
means
you
should
rely
on
those
around
you
instead
of
thinking
about
stuff
alone!
people
remember
their
high
school
days
as
the
high
point
of
their
lives.
people
say
these
things
because
everyone
holds
fond
memories
of
their
time
in
high
school;
however,
i
doubt
that
every
high
school
student
would
want
to
remember
their
school
life
that
way.
for
example,
if
neither
studying,
nor
sports,
nor
socializing
are
of
interest
to
someone,
what
then?
what
if
there
are
students
who
prefer
to
keep
a
low
profile?
though
i
guess
that
would
be
a
pretty
lonely
way
to
live.
i;ve
seen
places,
faces
and
smiled
for
a
moment.
but
oh,
you
haunted
me
so.
still
my
tongue
tied,
young
pride
would
not
let
my
love
for
you
show
in
case
you
say
no.
lonely
people
tend,
rather,
to
be
lonely
because
they
decline
to
bear
the
psychic
costs
of
being
around
other
humans.
they
are
allergic
to
people.
people
affect
them
too
strongly.
you
forget
everything.
the
hours
slip
by.
you
travel
in
your
chair
through
centuries
you
seem
to
see
before
you,
your
thoughts
are
caught
up
in
the
story,
dallying
with
the
details
or
following
the
course
of
the
plot,
you
enter
into
characters,
so
that
it
seems
as
if
it
were
your
own
heart
beating
beneath
their
costumes.
you;ve
gotta
choose
people
who
aren;t
much
more
motivated
than
you
are
but
don;t
surround
yourself
with
total
narcissists.
otherwise,
things
start
to
be
about
something
other
than
you.
the
day
will
come,
according
to

that
a

won;t
even
bother
to
cover
it.
all
falsehood
is
a
mask;
and
however

may
be,

i
stopped
in
the
middle
of
that
building
and
i
saw
-
the
sky.
i
saw
the
things
that
i
love
in
this
world.
the
work
and
the
food
and
the
time
to
sit
and
smoke.
and
i
looked
at
the
pen
and
i
thought
to
myself,
what
the
hell
am
i
grabbing
this
for?
why
am
i
trying
to
become
what
i
don;t
want
to
be?
what
am
i
doing
in
an
office,
making
a
contemptuous,
begging
fool
of
myself,
when
all
i
want
is
out
there,
waiting
for
me
the
minute
i
say
i
know
who
i
am!
if
i
fling
one
bag
of
trash
out
of
my
car
window
and
onto
the
highway,
it
won;t
seem
significant
or
destructive.
large
numbers
of
people
doing
the
same
thing,
though,
would
be
very
destructive.
well,
by
the
second
morning
i
was
out
of
food.
the
third
day
the
light
bulb
burnt
out.
pitch
black
in
there.
that;s
when
the
rats
started
coming
out.
i
dozed
off
and
i
felt
a
thing
nibbling
my
finger.
i
woke
up,
it
was,
you
know,
chewing
my
finger.
i
hate
all
the
rules
and
organization
and
teams
and
ranks
in
sports.
somebody;s
always
yelling
at
you,
telling
you
where
to
be,
what
to
do,
and
when
to
do
it.
i
figure
when
i
want
that,
i;ll
join
the
army
and
at
least
get
paid.
you
know,
you
go
to
thrift
shops
and
you
go
to
garage
sales
because
you
think
you;re
going
to
find
something
that;s,
you
know,
real
rare.
and
most
of
the
time,
it;s
a
total
waste
of
time,
but
once
in
a
while,
you;ll,
you;ll
come
up
with
something
that;ll
whet
your
appetite.
most
test
subjects
do
experience
some,
uh,
cognitive
deterioration
after
a
few
months
in
suspension.
now,
you;ve
been
under
for...
quite
a
bit
longer,
and
it;s
not
out
of
the
question
that
you
might
have
a
very
minor
case
of
serious
brain
damage.
but
don;t
be
alarmed,
all
right?
although,
if
you
do
feel
alarmed,
try
to
hold
onto
that
feeling,
because
that
is
the
proper
reaction
to
being
told
you
have
brain
damage.
what
is
going
to
happen
to
kazi,
mama?
he;s
the
only
one
who
looks
at
me
with
happy,
loving
eyes.
no
one
else
looks
at
me
that
way,
not
even
papa.
when
papa
looks
at
us,
his
eyes
are
always
looking
back
inside
his
head
at
his
own
thoughts.
he
sees
and
he
doesn;t
see.
what
good
are
prayers
and
shrines
to
a
person
mad
with
love?
the
flame
keeps
gnawing
into
her
tender
marrow
hour
by
hour,
and
deep
in
her
heart
the
silent
wound
lives
on.
mankind
doesn;t
need
warfare
and
bloodshed
to
prove
itself.
everyday
life
can
provide
honor
and
valor.
let;s
hope
that
from
now
on
this
country
can
find
its
heroes
in
smaller
places.

the
most
ordinary
of
deeds.
there;s
something
about
a
check
that,
to
a
man,
is
not
masculine.
i
don;t
know
exactly
what
it
is.
i
think
to
a
man,
a
check
is
like
a
note
from
your
mother
that
says
"i
don;t
have
any
money,
but
if
you;ll
contact
these
people,
i;m
sure
they;ll
stick
up
for
me.
if
you
just
trust
me
this
one
time
i
don;t
have
any
money
but
i
have
these.
i
wrote
on
these;
is
this
of
any
value
at
all?"
the
tricky
part
of
illness
is
that,
as
you
go
through
it,
your
values
are
constantly
changing.
you
try
to
figure
out
what
matters
to
you,
and
then
you
keep
figuring
it
out.
it
felt
like
someone
had
taken
away
my
credit
card
and
i
was
having
to
learn
how
to
budget.
you
may
decide
you
want
to
spend
your
time
working
as
a
neurosurgeon,
but
two
months
later,
you
may
feel
differently.
two
months
after
that,
you
may
want
to
learn
to
play
the
saxophone
or
devote
yourself
to
the
church.
death
may
be
a
one-time

but
living
with
terminal
illness
is
a
process.
chess
is
a
mental
exercise
that
can
be
pursued
for
its
own
sake
or
for
some
other
reason.
the
skills
required
to
play
a
strong
chess
game
include
the
ability
to
visualize,
the
ability
to
memorize,
the
ability
to
recognize
patterns,
the
ability
to
use
analytic
logic,
the
ability
to
plan
ahead,
the
ability
to
make
decisions,
and
the
ability
to
accept
the
consequences
of
your
actions.
is
it
any
wonder
that
chess
is
touted
as
a
useful
subject
for
study
in
many
schools?
wildflower
knew
i
wasn;t
well,
but
on
the
kitchen
floor
i
got
better
again.
i
grabbed
my
keys
and
drove
toward
a
star,
and
there
i
was
understood
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
;cause
that;s
when
i
was
introduced
to
true
serendipity.
i
knew
it
when
you
showed
up
again
in
the
snow,
i
was
always
told
your
heart
is
where
you;re
home.
if
the
cause
of
death
is

if
the
cause
of
death
is
not
specified,
the
person
will
simply
die
of
a
heart
attack.
after
writing
the
cause
of
death,
details
of
death
should
be
written
in
the
next
6
minutes
and

seconds.
you
move
like
i
want
to.
to
see
like
your
eyes
do.
if
i
had
been
downright
honest
with
myself,
i
would
have
seen
very
plainly
in
my
heart
that
i
did
but
half
fancy
being
committed
this
way
to
so
long
a
voyage,
without
once
laying
my
eyes
on
the
man
who
was
to
be
the
absolute
dictator
of
it,
so
soon
as
the
ship
sailed
out
upon
the
open
sea.
but
when
a
man
suspects
any
wrong,
it
sometimes
happens
that
if
he
be
already
involved
in
the
matter,
he
insensibly
strives
to
cover
up
his
suspicions
even
from
himself.
and
much
this
way
it
was
with
me.
i
said
nothing,
and
tried
to
think
nothing.
underneath
the
bridge
the
tarp
has
sprung
a
leak
and
the
animals
i;ve
trapped
have
all
become
my
pets
and
i;m
living
off
of
grass
and
the
drippings
from
the
ceiling
but
it;s
okay
to
eat
fish
;cause
they
don;t
have
any
feelings.
i
thought
i
was
gonna
be
the
first
funspot
kill
screen
and
then
i
had
three
fireballs
trap
me.
i
had
the
hammer
in
my
hand;
they
still
got
me.
so
anything
can
happen
in
donkey
kong.
so
for
someone
else
to
beat
me
to
the
kill
screen
would
be
a
letdown,
but
let;s
see
what
happens.
maybe
he;ll
crack
under
the
pressure
and
maybe
i;ll
get
my
chance
to
do
it
first.
take
my
love,
take
my
land,
take
me
where
i
cannot
stand.
i
don;t
care;
i;m
still
free.
you
can;t
take
the
sky
from
me.
take
me
out
to
the
black.
tell
them
i
ain;t
coming
back.
inside
his
house
a
kid
gets
one
name,
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
door,
it;s
whatever
the
rest
of
the
world
wants
to
call
him.
meanwhile
he
himself,
the
prince,
had
risen
to
his
feet;
the
sudden
movement
of
his
huge
frame
made
the
floor
tremble,
and
a
glint
of
pride
flashed
in
his
light
blue
eyes
at
this
fleeting
confirmation
of
his
lordship
over
both
human
beings
and
their
works.
i
think
about
all
the
people
i;ve
loved,
now
long
gone.
i
think
about
my
beautiful
jan,
and
how
i
lost
her
so
many
years
ago.
i
think
about
all
of
us
walking
our
own
green
mile,
each
in
our
own
time.
but
one
thought,
more
than
any
other,
keeps
me
awake
most
nights.
if
he
could
make
a
mouse
live
so
long,
how
much
longer
do
i
have?
we
each
owe
a
death,
there
are
no
exceptions,
but
sometimes,
oh
god,
the
green
mile
seems
so
long.
there;s
no
pretty
way
to
put
this.
i
grew
up
in
the
suburbs.
i
guess
most
people
think
of
the
suburb
as
a
place
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
the
city
and
none
of
the
advantages
of
the
country.
and
vice
versa.
but
in
a
way
those
really
were
the
wonder
years
for
us
there
in
the
suburbs.
it
was
kind
of
a
golden
age
for
kids.
you
have
been
on
my
mind,
i;ve
been
trying
to
let
it
go.
i;ve
been
trying
to
find
something
as
incredible.
don;t
you
see?
what
these
two
people,
who
are
such
geniuses
at
romance,
are
trying
to
do
is
to
get
you
to
take
your
hair
down,
thinking
that
it
will
stimulate
me
like
some
sort
of
pavlovian
dog.
so,
why
don;t
you
just
oblige
them.
get
this
silliness
over
with
so
we
can
get
on
with
our
lives.
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
just
following
your
heart,
and
eventually
you;ll
finally
get
it
right.
the
things
you;re
looking
for,
montag,
are
in
the
world,
but
the
only
way
the
average
chap
will
ever
see
ninety-nine
percent
of
them
is
in
a
book.
so
i
built
a
machine;
a
human
machine.
i
made
it
with
steel
and
soy-protein.
born
from
a
test
tube
and
into

vat.
to
live
and
to
heave
and
to
die
just
like
that.
she
asks
me
to
kill
the
spider.
instead,
i
get
the
most
peaceful
weapons
i
can
find.
i
take
a
cup
and
a
napkin.
i
catch
the
spider,
put
it
outside
and
allow
it
to
walk
away.
if
i
am
ever
caught
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time,
just
being
alive
and
not
bothering
anyone,
i
hope
i
am
greeted
with
the
same
kind
of
mercy.
my
name
is
turkish.
funny
name
for
an
englishman,
i
know.
my
parents
to
be
were
on
the
same
plane
when
it
crashed.
that;s
how
they
met.
they
named
me
after
the
name
of
the
plane.
not
many
people
are
named
after
a
plane
crash.
this
is
our
hope.
this
is
the
faith
with
which
i
return
to
the
south.
with
this
faith
we
will
be
able
to
hew
out
of
the
mountain
of
despair
a
stone
of
hope.
with
this
faith
we
will
be
able
to
transform
the
jangling
discords
of
our
nation
into
a
beautiful
symphony
of
brotherhood.
with
this
faith
we
will
be
able
to
work
together,
to
pray
together,
to
struggle
together,
to
go
to
jail
together,
to
stand
up
for
freedom
together,
knowing
that
we
will
be
free
one
day.
all
this
time
we
wait
on
this
shallow
line
for
a
martyr
to
save
our
lives
when
you
can;t.
a
warning
sign,
a
lack
in
reaction
time,
mixed
with
a
war
to
fight
keeps
us
here.
the
tide
is
in.
it;s
time
we
all
learn
to
swim.
these
rooftops
won;t
save
our
lives
and
nor
did
you.
everything;s
all
right.
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember,
i
have
always
found
it
easier
to
add
and
subtract
numbers
from
left
to
right
instead
of
from
right
to
left.
by
adding
and
subtracting
numbers
this
way,
i
found
that
i
could
call
out
the
answers
to
math
problems
in
class
well
before
my
classmates
put
down
their
pencils.
and
i
didn;t
even
need
a
pencil!
a
wise
man
will
not
leave
the
right
to
the
mercy
of
chance,
nor
wish
it
to
prevail
through
the
power
of
the
majority.
give
not
thyself
up,
then,
to
fire,
lest
it
invert
thee,
deaden
thee,
as
for
the
time
it
did
me.
there
is
a
wisdom
that
is
woe;
but
there
is
a
woe
that
is
madness.
it
is
known
that
many
of
the
germs
which
cause
diseases
cannot
get
into
the
body
unless
the
protecting
membranes
have
first
been
injured
in
some
way.
thus
the
germs
that
cause
plague
and
lockjaw
find
their
way
into
the
system
principally
through
abrasions
of
the
skin.
many
physicians
have
come
to
believe
that
the
typhoid
fever
germ
cannot
get
into
the
body
from
the
intestine
where
it
is
taken
with
our
food
or
drink
unless
the
walls
of
the
intestine
have
been
injured
in
some
way.
i
have
something
here
for
you.
your
father
wanted
you
to
have
this
when
you
were
old
enough,
but
your
uncle
wouldn;t
allow
it.
he
feared
you
might
follow
old
obi-wan
on
some
damn
fool
idealistic
crusade
like
your
father
did.
the
game
of
chess
is
not
merely
an
idle
amusement.
several
very
valuable
qualities
of
the
mind,
useful
in
the
course
of
human
life,
are
to
be
acquired
or
strengthened
by
it,
so
as
to
become
habits,
ready
on
all
occasions.
for
life
is
a
kind
of
chess,
in
which
we
have
often
points
to
gain,
and
competitors
or
adversaries
to
contend
with,
and
in
which
there
is
a
vast
variety
of
good
and
ill
events,
that
are,
in
some
degree,
the
effects
of
prudence
or
the
want
of
it.
a
field,
though
fertile,
cannot
yield
a
harvest
without
cultivation,
no
more
can
the
mind
without
learning;
thus
each
is
feeble
without
the
other.
what
have
you
done?
you
have
awakened
in
me
all
that
should
have
stayed
dormant.
i
have
sought
a
tranquil
existence,
and
had
it,
until
i
saw
you.
since
then
my
powers
have
failed
me,
for
i
cannot
rid
myself
of
you.
in
every
book
i
read,
i
see
your
face.
in
every
sound,
i
hear
your
voice,
or
the
jingle
of
your
tambourine.
i;ve
questioned
my
conscience
through
the
deep
hours
of
the
night
only
to
awaken
in
greater
confusion.
i
have
spoken

war
is
upon

all
our
friends,
a
war
in
which
only
the

of
the

give
us

of
victory.
it
fills
me
with
great
sorrow

fear:

from
so
little

so
much

out

i
don;t
think
it
really
helped
me,
in
my
love
life,
my
nascent
love
life.
i
think
that
having
won
something
like
that
could
be
regarded
as
being
a
significant
liability.
this
is
the
problem
with
danger,
isn;t
it?
you
can
even
be

the
bizarre
thing
is,
is
that
i
did
it
for
my
old
man...
i
tortured
this
poor
kid,
because
i
wanted
him
to
think
that
i
was
cool.
he;s
always
going
off
about
you
know
when
he
was
in
school,
all
the
wild
things
he
used
to
do.
and
i
got
the
feeling
that
he
was
disappointed
that
i
never
cut
loose
on
anyone,

about
the

asking
for.
i

i
don;t

i

i
do
not

i

just

as
harry
and
ron
walked
back
to
the
castle
for
dinner,
their
pockets
weighed
down
with
rock
cakes
they;d
been
too
polite
to
refuse,
harry
thought
that
none
of
the
lessons
he;d
had
so
far
had
given
him
as
much
to
think
about
as
tea
with
hagrid.
how
often
do
you
think
about
why
your
friends
came
into
your
life?
was
it
random?
by
design?
or
maybe
a
little
of
both?
regardless
of
the
reasons,
some
friends
you
just
know
are
gonna
be
by
your
side
for
a
while.
others,
you;re
not
so
sure.
and
then
there;s
that
one
friend
who...
well,
you
hope
one
day
becomes
something
more,
but
friend
will
have
to
do
for
now.
and
that;s
okay,
i
guess.
every
new

from

i
have
been
trying
to
break
out
for
too
long
from
the
cage.
i
found
my
path
when
i
thought
that
i
was
wrong.
stay
close
to
me,
to
me.
i;ll
show
you
what
you
need
to
see,
to
see.
so,
i
must
be
taken
as
i
have
been
made.
the
success
is
not
mine,
the
failure
is
not
mine,
but
the
two
together
make
me.
i;m
happy
here.
you
know,
someone
once
told
me
my
life
is
a
dream
with
an
anklet
attached.
if
i
wake
up
tomorrow
and
that
anklet
is
still
on,
i
have
a
good
job,
a
wonderful
home,
a
partner
and
a
best
friend.
a
family.
but
to
wake
up
and
answer
only
to
myself,
that
would
mean
everything.
i
have
lived
to
see
strange
days.
long
we
have
tended
our
beasts
and
our
fields,
built
our
houses,
wrought
our
tools,
or
ridden
away
to
help
in
the
wars
of
minas
tirith.
and
that
we
called
the
life
of
men,
the
way
of
the
world.
we
cared
little
for
what
lay
beyond
the
borders
of
our
land.
songs
we
have
that
tell
of
these
things,
but
we
are
forgetting
them,
teaching
them
only
to
children,
as
a
careless
custom.
and
now
the
songs
have
come
down
among
us
out
of
strange
places,
and
walk
visible
under
the
sun.
and
even
though
the
moment
passed
me
by,
i
still
can;t
turn
away.
;cause
all
the
dreams
you
never
thought
you;d
lose
got
tossed
along
the
way.
and
letters
that
you
never
meant
to
send
got
lost
or
thrown
away.
and
now
we;re
grown
up
orphans
that
never
knew
their
names.
we
don;t
belong
to
no
one;
that;s
a
shame.
if
you
could
hide
inside
me,
maybe
for
a
while,
and
i
won;t
tell
no
one
your
name.
that;s
always
seemed
so
ridiculous
to
me,
that
people
want
to
be
around
someone
because
they;re
pretty.
it;s
like
picking
your
breakfast
cereals
based
on
color
instead
of
taste.
as
to
my
own
part,
having
turned
my
thoughts
for
many
years
upon
this
important
subject,
and
maturely
weighed
the
several
schemes
of
other
projectors,
i
have
always
found
them
grossly
mistaken
in
their
computation.
here
we
go,
off
the
rails,
don;t
you
know
it;s
time
to
raise
our
sails.

you
never
knew.

comes
the
rain
again,
falling
from
the

in
my
pain

who
we
are.

my
memory

never

what
i
lost.

it
was
in

a

important
part
of

look,
i;m
not
the
first
guy
who
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
he
met
in
a
restaurant
who
then
turned
out
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
kidnapped
scientist,
only
to
lose
her
to
her
childhood
lover
who
she;d
last
seen
on
a
deserted
island,
and
who
turned
out
fifteen
years
later
to
be
the
leader
of
the
french
underground.

birds
in
the
trees
sing
their
day
full
of
song,
why
shouldn;t
we
sing
along?
i;m
chipper
all
the
day,
happy
with
my
lot.
how
do
i
get
that
way?
look
at
what
i;ve
got.
i
am
very
proud,
revengeful,
ambitious,
with
more
offences
at
my
beck
than
i
have
thoughts
to
put
them
in,
imagination
to
give
them
shape,
or
time
to
act
them
in.
i
have
spent
my
whole
life
scared,
frightened
of
things
that
could
happen,
might
happen,
might
not
happen.
50
years
i
spent
like
that,
finding
myself
awake
at
three
in
the
morning.
but
you
know
what?
ever
since
my
diagnosis,
i
sleep
just
fine.
what
i
came
to
realize
is
that
fear,
that;s
the
worst
of
it.
that;s
the
real
enemy.
so
get
up,
get
out
in
the
real
world,
and
you
kick
that
bastard
as
hard
as
you
can
right
in
the
teeth.
i
was
just
guessing
at
numbers
and
figures,
pulling
the
puzzles
apart.
questions
of
science,
science
and
progress
do
not
speak
as
loud
as
my
heart.
my
pop
was
real
big.
he
did
like
he
pleased.
that;s
why
everybody
worked
on
him.
the
last
time
i
seen
my
father,
he
was
blind
and
diseased
from
drinking.
and
every
time
he
put
the
bottle
to
his
mouth,
he
didn;t
suck
out
of
it,
it
sucked
out
of
him
until
he
shrunk
so
wrinkled
and
yellow
even
the
dogs
didn;t
know
him.
i
said
that
i
would
see
you
because
i
had
heard
that
you
were
a
serious
man.
a
man
to
be
treated
with
respect
but
i
must
say
no
to
you
and
i
will
give
you
my
reasons.
it;s
true,
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
in
politics.
but
they
wouldn;t
be
so
friendly
if
they
knew
my
business
was
drugs
instead
of
gambling
which
they
consider
a
harmless
vice,
but
drugs,
that;s
a
dirty
business.
with
the
coming
of
dean
moriarty
began
the
part
of
my
life
you
could
call
my
life
on
the
road.
before
that
i;d
often
dreamed
of
going
west
to
see
the
country,
always
vaguely
planning
and
never
taking
off.
dean
is
the
perfect
guy
for
the
road
because
he
actually
was
born
on
the
road,
when
his
parents
were
passing
through
salt
lake
city.
you
know,
that
might
be
the
answer
-
to
act
boastfully
about
something
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of.
that;s
a
trick
that
never
seems
to
fail.
estella,
to
the
last
hour
of
my
life,
you
cannot
choose
but
remain
part
of
my
character,
part
of
the
little
good
in
me,
part
of
the
evil.
but,
in
this
separation
i
associate
you
only
with
the
good,
and
i
will
faithfully
hold
you
to
that
always,
for
you
must
have
done
me
far
more
good
than
harm,
let
me
feel
now
what
sharp
distress
i
may.
o
god
bless
you,
god
forgive
you!
my
mind
is
open
so
wide
since
you
came
inside,
i
feel
so
alive.
i
was
blinded,
your
smile
shining
behind
those
green
eyes.
the
horizon
so
enticing,
please
say
you;ll
be
mine.
the
crowd
is
running
for
their
lives.
i
think
i;m
going
to
step
inside.
i
can;t
stand
here
and
watch
this
anymore.
no,
i
can;t
go
in
there.
children
are
searching
for
their
mothers
and
oh,
not
since
the
hindenburg
tragedy
has
there
been
anything
like
this.
all
i
have
to
do
is
divine
from
what
i
know
of
you:
are
you
the
sort
of
man
who
would
put
the
poison
into
his
own
goblet
or
his
enemy;s?
now,
a
clever
man
would
put
the
poison
into
his
own
goblet,
because
he
would
know
that
only
a
great
fool
would
reach
for
what
he
was
given.
i
am
not
a
great
fool,
so
i
can
clearly
not
choose
the
wine
in
front
of
you.
but
you
must
have
known
i
was
not
a
great
fool,
you
would
have
counted
on
it,
so
i
can
clearly
not
choose

at
lunch
he
told
bill
about
a
physics
book
he
was
reading
about
time.
how
the
passing
of
time
is
just
an
illusion
because
all
of
eternity
is
actually
taking
place
at
once:
the
past
never
vanishes
away
and
the
future
has
already
happened.
all
of
history
is
fixed
and
laid
out,
like
an
infinite
landscape
of
simultaneous
events
that
we
simply
happen
to
travel
through
in
one
direction.
bill
made
a
joke
that
he
could;ve
sworn
he;d
been
told
that
somewhere
before,
but
the
guy
just
stared
at
him
like
he
didn;t
get
it.
you;re
just
a
whiny
little
basket
case
who;s
milking
this
depression
thing
for
all
it;s
worth.
so
here
it
is,
four
in
the
afternoon
and
you
get
to
do
exactly
what
you
want,
well,
way
to
go.
now
excuse
me,
but
i
got
a
zillion
chores
to
do
or
mom
and
dad
are
gonna
kick
my
butt.
;cause
what
the
world
needs
now
is
a
new
kind
of
tension
;cause
the
old
one
just
bores
me
to
death.
;cause
what
the
world
needs
now
is
another
folk
singer
like
i
need
a
hole
in
my
head.
well,
that
idea
might
make
a
stupid
idea
feel
better
about
itself.
how
many
times
have
you
seen
the
leader
of
a
race
have
a
mechanical
problem
with
only
a
few
laps
to
go?
you
will
never
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
their
problems
if
you
are
not
close.
you
have
to
be
close
to
take
advantage
of
luck.
well
the
years
start
coming
and
they
don;t
stop
coming.

so
much
to
do,
so
much
to
see.
so
what;s
wrong
with
taking
the
back
streets?
you;ll
never
know
if
you
don;t
go.
you;ll
never
shine
if
you
don;t
glow.
i
was
never
more
hated
than
when
i
tried
to
be
honest.
or
when,
even
as
just
now
i;ve
tried
to
articulate
exactly
what
i
felt
to
be
the
truth.
no
one
was
satisfied.
when
the
shoes
first
fell
from
the
sky,
he
remembered
thinking
that
destiny
had
struck
him.
now
he
thought
so
again.
it
was
more
than
a
coincidence.
it
had
to
be
destiny.
come
as
you
are,
as
you
were,
as
i
want
you
to
be.
as
a
friend,
as
a
friend,
as
a
known
enemy.
take
your
time,
hurry
up.
the
choice
is
yours,
don;t
be
late.
take
a
rest
as
a
friend,
as
an
old
memoria.
yes.
i
consider
myself
a
nerd.
and
this
movie
has
uplifted
me.
there;s
this
one
scene,
where
a
nerd
grabs
the
microphone
during
a
pep
rally
and
announces
that
he
is
a
nerd
and
that
he
is
proud
of
it
and
stands
up
for
the
rights
of
other
nerds.
i
do
not
for
one
think
that
the
problem
was
that
the
band
was
down.
i
think
that
the
problem
may
have
been
that
there
was
a
stonehenge
monument
on
the
stage
that
was
in
danger
of
being
crushed
by
a
dwarf.
all
right?
that
tended
to
understate
the
hugeness

it;s

what
begins
as
a

ends
as
a
market

when
you
rule
out

simply
by
their

you

i
once
lived
in
the
lost
woods,
until
the
day
i
wandered
into
a
magic
transporter.
the
power
of
the
dark
world
quickly
turned
me
into
this
tree

i
guess
the
two
forests

connected
with

that
woman
has
to
show
you;re
a
fraud,
but
as
far
as
the
world
knows
you;re
a
goddamn
lawyer
and
that;s
the
way
it;s
gonna
stay.
don;t
forget,
we
don;t
need
to
prove
you;re
a
lawyer;
she
needs
to
prove
you;re
not.
i
can
always
tell
when
you;re
lying.
i
also
know
that
you
cannot
tell
me
why
you
do
so.
so
there
is
no
need
to
convince
me,
or
wrap
everything
in
lies,
or
try
to
take
the
blame
on
yourself
like
that.

i

i
was
assailed
by
memories
of
a
life
that
wasn;t
mine
anymore,
but
one
in
which
i;d
found
the
simplest
and
most
lasting
joys:
the
smells
of
summer,
the
part
of
town
i
loved,
a
certain
evening
sky,
marie;s
dresses
and
the
way
she
laughed.
i
think
i
really
like
it
best
when
you
can
kid
the
pants
off
a
girl
when
the
opportunity
arises.
i
guess
this
is
just
another
lost
cause,
mr.
paine.
all
you
people
don;t
know
about
lost
causes.
mr.
paine
does.
he
said
once
they
were
the
only
causes
worth
fighting
for
and
he
fought
for
them
once.
for
the
only
reason
any
man
ever
fights
for
them.
because
of
just
one
plain
simple
rule.
love
thy
neighbor.
i;ve
always
loathed
the
necessity
of
sleep.
like
death,
it
puts
even
the
most
powerful
men
on
their
backs.
it
is
a
custom
of
our
justice
to
condemn
some
as
a
warning
to
others.
to
condemn
them
because
they
have
done
wrong
would
be
stupidity,
as
plato
says.
for
what
is
done
cannot
be
undone.
but
they
are
condemned
that
they
may
not
go
wrong
again
in
the
same
way,
or
that
others
may
avoid
following
their
example.
we
do
not
correct
the
man

hang;
we
correct
others
through
him.
i
do
the
same.
my
errors
are
sometimes
natural
and
incorrigible;
but
whereas
honest
men
benefit
the
public
by
setting
an
example,
i
may
perhaps
benefit
them
by
making
them
avoid
my
example.

there
will
be
no
fine

if
you
feel
the
need
to
clean
out
her

down

from
the
refrigerator;
turn
over
a
school
portrait

pass

my
friend,
i
shall
be
pedagogic,
and
say
you
ought
to
start
with
logic.
days
will
be
spent
to
let
you
know
that
what
you
once
did
at
one
blow,
like
eating
and
drinking
so
easy
and
free,
can
only
be
done
with
one,
two,
three.
people
think
that
a
liar
gains
a
victory
over
his
victim.
what
i;ve
learned
is
that
a
lie
is
an
act
of
self-abdication,
because
one
surrenders
one;s
reality
to
the
person
to
whom
one
lies,
making
that
person
one;s
master,
condemning
oneself
from
then
on
to
faking
the
sort
of
reality
that
person;s
view
requires
to
be
faked.
and
if
one
gains
the
immediate
purpose
of
the
lie
-
the
price
one
pays
is
the
destruction
of
what
the
gain
was
intended
to
serve.
the
man
who
lies
to
the
world
is
the
world;s
slave
from
then
on.
my
aunt
used
to
live
in
paris.
i
remember,
she
used
to
come
home
and
she
would
tell
us
stories
about
being
abroad,
and
i
remember
she
told
us
she
jumped
into
the
river
once.
barefoot.
she
smiled.
leapt
without
looking,
and
tumbled
into
the
seine.
the
water
was
freezing,
she
spent
a
month
sneezing,
but
said
she
would
do
it
again.
it
must
have
been
love,
but
it;s
over
now.
it
must
have
been
good,
but
i
lost
it
somehow.
the
mother
was
gravely
injured.
her
only
choice
was
to
entrust
the
child
to
the
deku
tree,
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
forest.
the
deku
tree
could
sense
that
this
was
a
child
of
destiny,
whose
fate
would
affect
the
entire
world,
so
he
took
him
into
the
forest.
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death.
and
i;ll
fear
no
evil
because
i;m
blind
to
it
all.
and
my
mind
and
my
gun
they
comfort
me.
because
i
know
i;ll
kill
my
enemies
when
they
come.
surely
goodness
and
mercy
will
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
i
will
dwell
on
this
earth
forevermore.
still
i
walk
beside
the
still
waters
and
they
restore
my
soul.
but
i
can;t
walk
on
the
path
of
the
right
because
i;m
wrong.
perhaps
i;m
just
projecting
my
own
concern
about
it.
i
know
i;ve
never
completely
freed
myself
from
the
suspicion
that
there
are
some
extremely
odd
things
about
this
mission.
i;m
sure
you
agree
there;s
some
truth
in
what
i
say.
this
town
is
very
peaceful.
yes,
and
that
is
why
there
are
so
many
flowers.
but...
i
have
heard
there
are
places
in
the
world
where
no
flowers
bloom.
i
could
never
forgive
myself
if
i
did
nothing
to
try
to
bring
flowers
to
such
places.
that
is
why
i
shoot
out
spores
as
often
as
i
can.
it
is
my
civic
duty!
when
i
grow
up,
i;m
not
going
to
read
the
newspaper
and
i;m
not
going
to
follow
complex
issues
and
i;m
not
going
to
vote.
that
way
i
can
complain
that
the
government
doesn;t
represent
me.
then,
when
everything
goes
down
the
tubes,
i
can
say
the
system
doesn;t
work
and
justify
my
further
lack
of
participation.
we
have
a
criminal
jury
system
which
is
superior
to
any
in
the
world
and
its
efficiency
is
only
marred
by
the
difficulty
of
finding
twelve
men
every
day
who
don;t
know
anything
and
can;t
read.
she
dreams
of
1969
before
the
soldiers
came.
the
life
was
cheap
on
bread
and
wine
and
sharing
meant
no
shame.
she
is
awakened
by
the
screams
of
rockets
flying
from
nearby,
and
scared
she
clings
onto
her
dreams
to
beat
the
fear
that
she
might
die.
that;s
what
the
money
is
for!
you
should
be
thanking
me
every
morning
when
you
wake
up,
along
with
jesus,
for
giving
you
another
day!
all
the
old
paintings
on
the
tomb,
they
do
the
sand
dance,
don;t
you
know?
if
they
move
too
quick,
they;re
falling
down
like
a
domino.
faith
always
starts
with
desire.
that
means
we
want
something
to
happen,
badly.
the
important
thing,
i
think,
is
not
to
be
bitter.
you
know,
if
it
turns
out
that
there
is
a
god,
i
don;t
think
that
he;s
evil.
i
think
that
the
worst
you
can
say
about
him
is
basically
he;s
an
underachiever.
after
all,
you
know,
there
are
worse
things
in
life
than
death.
if
you;ve
ever
spent
an
evening
with
an
insurance
salesman,
you
know
exactly
what
i
mean.
the
key
here
is
to
not
think
of
death
as
an
end,
but
think
of
it
more
as
a
very
effective
way
of
cutting
down
on
your
expenses.
the
time
i
waited
seemed
endless,
and
i
felt
doubts
and
fears
crowding
upon
me.
what
sort
of
place
had
i
come
to,
and
among
what
kind
of
people?
what
sort
of
grim
adventure
was
it
on
which
i
had
embarked?
girls
in
white
dresses
with
blue
satin
sashes,
snowflakes
that
stay
on
my
nose
and
eyelashes,
silver-white
winters
that
melt
into
springs,
these
are
a
few
of
my
favorite
things.
there
is
a
door
at
the
end
of
a
silent
corridor.
and
it;s
haunting
harry
potter;s
dreams.
why
else
would
he
be
waking
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
screaming
in
terror?
i
am
assured
by
our
merchants,
that
a
boy
or
a
girl
before
twelve
years
old,
is
no
salable
commodity,
and
even
when
they
come
to
this
age,
they
will
not
yield
above
three
pounds,
or
three
pounds
and
half
a
crown
at
most,
on
the
exchange;
which
cannot
turn
to
account
either
to
the
parents
or
kingdom,
the
charge
of
nutriments
and
rags
having
been
at
least
four
times
that
value.
i
want
this
mark
all
the
way
back
to
earth
with
time
to
spare.
we;ve
never
lost
an
american
in
space,
we;re
sure
as
hell
not
gonna
lose
one
on
my
watch.
failure
is
not
an
option!
i
thought
i
was
part
of
the
family.
i
thought
i
mattered...
but
i
was
just
their
toy,
something
to
throw
away
when
you;re
done
with
it.
i
don;t
know
that
i
brood.
i
just
occasionally
take
time
out
to
silently
consider
the
specific
ways
in
which
others
have
wronged
me.
i
don;t
know
why
he
saved
my
life.
maybe
in
those
last
moments
he
loved
life
more
than
he
ever
had
before.
not
just
his
life,
anybody;s
life,
my
life.
all
he;d
wanted
were
the
same
answers
the
rest
of
us
want.
where
did
i
come
from?
where
am
i
going?
how
long
have
i
got?
once
you
get
into
the
processed

you
have
to
be

determined

detective

follow
the
intricate
and
increasingly
obscure
lines
of
connection
linking
the
twinkie,
or
the
nondairy
creamer,
to
a
plant
growing
in
the
earth
some
place,
but
it
can
be
done.
it
is
by
will
alone
i
set
my
mind
in
motion.
it
is
by
the
juice
of
sapho
that
thoughts
acquire
speed,
the
lips
acquire
stains,
the
stains
become
a
warning.
it
is
by
will
alone
i
set
my
mind
in
motion.
i;m
wearying
to
escape
into
that
glorious
world,
and
to
be
always
there:
not
seeing
it
dimly
through
tears,
and
yearning
for
it
through
the
walls
of
an
aching
heart:
but
really
with
it,
and
in
it.
just
as
there
are
painters
and

the

there
are

some
things
you
just
can;t
explain.
you
don;t
even
try.
you
don;t
know
where
to
start.

your
sentences
would
jumble
up
like
a
giant
knot
if
you
opened

any
words
you
used
would
come
out
wrong.
it
doesn;t
matter
who
you
are
or
what
you
look
like,
so
long
as
somebody
loves
you.
okay
everybody,
gather
round.
i
want
you
to
watch
me
pay
these
bills.
i;m
pretty
sure
there;s
a
lot
more
to
life
than
being
really,
really
good-looking.
and
i
plan
on
finding
out
what
that
is.
what
is
new
about
the
space
age
is
that
it
brings
home
to
us,
in
concrete
ways,
a
possibility
that
would
have
shocked
and
dismayed
our
ancestors:
that
the
heavens
might
be
empty.
at
three
in
the
morning
the
blood
runs
slow
and
thick,
and
slumber
is
heavy.
the
soul
either
sleeps
in
blessed
ignorance
of
such
an
hour
or
gazes
about
itself
in
utter
despair.
there
is
no
middle
ground.
poor
alice!
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do,
lying
down
on
one
side,
to
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
eye;
but
to
get
through
was
more
hopeless.
i
see
a
beautiful
city
and
a
brilliant
people
rising
from
this
abyss,
and,
in
their
struggles
to
be
truly
free,
in
their
triumphs
and
defeats,
through
long
years
to
come,
i
see
the
evil
of
this
time
and
of
the
previous
time
of
which
this
is
the
natural
birth,
gradually
making
expiation
for
itself
and
wearing
out.
as
the
red
day
is
dawning
and
the
lightning
cracks
the
sky,
they;ll
raise
their
hands
to
the
heavens
above
with
resentment
to
their
eyes.
running
back
from
the
mid-morning
light,
there;s
a
burning
in
my
heart.
we;re
banished
from
a
time
in
a
fallen
land
to
a
life
beyond
the
stars.
in
your
darkest
dreams
see
to
believe
our
destiny
is
time.
and
endlessly
we;ll
all
be
free
tonight.
i
only
see
my
goals,
i
don;t
believe
in
failure
;cause
i
know
the
smallest
voices,
they
can
make
it
major.
i
got
my
boys
with
me,
at
least
those
in
favor.
and
if
we
don;t
meet
before
i
leave,
i
hope
i;ll
see
you
later.

it;s
got
me
laughing,
now
it;s
got
me
crying.
all
my
life
i
will
be
death-defying
;til
i
know...
i
wonder,
wonder
why
the
wonder
falls.
i
wonder
why
the
wonder
falls
on
me.
i
wonder,
wonder
why
the
wonder
falls
with
everything
i
touch
and
hear
and
see.
if
you
had
an
injury
and
your
doctor
said
it
might
help,
would
you
be
willing
to
let
leeches
feast
for
a
few
minutes,
say,
on
your
hand?
on
your
face?
in
the
early
days
of
america,
when
men
wore
ruffles
on
their
shirts
and
buckles
on
their
shoes,
when
they
rode
horseback
and
swore
allegiance
to
the
king
of
england,
there
lived
in
boston
a
man
who
cared
for
none
of
these
things.
his
name
was
samuel
adams.
his
clothes
were
shabby
and
plain,
he
refused
to
get
on
a
horse
and
he
hated
the
king
of
england.
you
realize
that
trying
to
keep
your
distance
from
me
will
not
lessen
my
affection
for
you.
all
efforts
to
save
me
from
you
will
fail.
our
evaluations
of
reflection
and
transmission
at
material
interfaces
in
various
situations
will,
in
addition
to
the
underlying
physical
processes
and
mathematical
relations
between
the
local
fields
and
waves
at
the
interfaces,
also
include
all
implications
to
the
distributions
of
total
fields
and
waves
in
each
of
the
material
regions
in
the
system,
as
well
as
the
related
energy
and
power
considerations.
for
it
was
said
that
they
had
become
like
those
peculiar
demons
which
dwell
in
matter,
but
in
which
no
light
may
be
found.
being
human
is
about
fighting
even
when
it
seems
hopeless,
and
finding
happiness
even
in
a
world
that
hates
it.
this
made
me
reflect,
how
vain
an
attempt
it
is
for
a
man
to
endeavor
to
do
himself
honor
among
those
who
are
out
of
all
degree
of
equality
or
comparison
with
him.
i
hadn;t
realized
that
music
could
unlock
things
in
you,
could
transport
you
to
somewhere
even
the
composer
hadn;t
predicted.
it
left
an
imprint
in
the
air
around
you,
as
if
you
carried
its
remnants
with
you
when
you
went.
some
people
can;t
believe
in
themselves
until
someone
else
believes
in
them
first.
you
can
work
back
to
god
from
the
phenomenal
universe,
or
you
can
move
from
the
creator
to
the
phenomenal
universe.
each
implies
the
other.
the
creator
would
not
be
the
creator
if
there
were
no
universe,
and
the
universe
would
cease
to
be
if
the
creator
did
not
sustain
it.
the
creator
does
not
exist
prior
to
the
universe
in
time;
he
does
not
exist
in
time
at
all.
god
creates
the
universe
constantly;
he
is
with
it,
not
above
or
behind
it.
this
is
impossible
to
understand
for
you
because
you
are
a
created
thing
and
exist
in
time.
but
eventually
you
will
return
to
your
creator
and
then
you
will
again
no
longer
exist
in
time.
every
minute
of
every
day
we
choose.
who
we
are.
who
we
forgive.
who
we
defend
and
protect.
to
choose
a
side
or
to
walk
the
line.
to
play
the
middle.
to
straddle
the
fence
between
what
is
and
what
should
be.
this
was
the
course
i
chose.
trying
to
find
the
delicate
balance
of
interests
that
can
never
exist.
choosing
by
not
choosing.
defending
a
center
which
cannot
hold.
so
death
chose
for
me.
when
i
saw
the
break
of
day,
i
wished
that
i
could
fly
away.
very
well,
gentlemen.
this,
and
maybe
other
similar
things,
is
what
i
have
to
say
in
my
defense.
perhaps
one
of
you
might
be
angry
as
he
recalls
that
when
he
himself
stood
trial
on
a
less
dangerous
charge,
he
begged
and
implored
the
jurymen
with
many
tears,
that
he
brought
his
children
and
many
of
his
friends
and
family
into
the
court
to
arouse
as
much
pity
as
he
could,
but
that
i
do
none
of
these
things,
even
though
i
may
seem
to
be
running
the
ultimate
risk.
alright,
how
about
the
fact
that
this
is
actually
happening?
you
have
your
armies,
you
have
your
ships,
you
have
your
dragons...
everything
you
ever
wanted,
since
you
were
old
enough
to
want
anything.
it;s
all
yours
for
the
taking.
are
you
afraid?
good.
you;re
in
the
great
game
now,
and
the
great
game
is
terrifying.
the
only
people
who
aren;t
afraid
of
failure
are
madmen
like
your
father.
any
physical
theory
is
always
provisional,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
only
a
hypothesis:
you
can
never
prove
it.
no
matter
how
many
times
the
results
of
experiments
agree
with
some
theory,
you
can
never
be
sure
that
the
next
time
the
result
will
not
contradict
the
theory.
you
know,
this
place
makes
me
wonder,
which
would
be
worse...
to
live
as
a
monster?
or
to
die
as
a
good
man?
while
walking
through
the
train,
luke
and
i
encountered
a
lady
by
the
name
of
babette.
this
woman,
large
in
both
stature
and
character,
was
in
a
dreadful
panic
over
her
lost
boy,
tom.
it
seems
the
child
got
away
from
her
while
she
was
distracted,
leaving
only
a
single
tiny
shoe
behind.
where
could
a
child
that
small
have
wandered
off
to?
every
magic
trick
consists
of
three
parts,
or
acts.
the
first
part
is
called
the
pledge,
the
magician
shows
you
something
ordinary.
the
second
act
is
called
the
turn,
the
magician
takes
the
ordinary
something
and
makes
it
into
something
extraordinary.
but
you
wouldn;t
clap
yet,
because
making
something
disappear
isn;t
enough.
you
have
to
bring
it
back.
see,
in
the
perfect
world,
i
would
be
perfect,

i
don;t
trust
people
enough
beyond
the
surface

i
don;t
love
people
enough
to
put
my
faith
in
men,
i
put
my
faith
in
these
lyrics,
hoping
i
make

the
sky
people
have
sent
us
a
message
that
they
can
take
whatever
they
want.
that
no
one
can
stop
them.
well,
we
will
send
them
a
message.
you
ride
out
as
fast
as
the
wind
can
carry
you.
you
tell
the
other
clans
to

them!
sir,
there
was
this
idiotic
round
robin.
it
was
sarcastic.
there
was
no
way
they
didn;t
know
that.
they
were
just
mad
at
me
for
imposing
discipline
and
calling
them
stupid.
if
only
sorrow
could
build
a
staircase
or
tears
could
show
the
way.
i
would
climb
my
way
to

and
bring

to

he
looked
at

and
wondered
what
lay
beyond

its
borders.

a

set
a
man
on
fire,
and
he;ll
be
warm
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
but
i
had
a
point
here.
a
lesson,
if
you
will.
there
are
other
organisations
out
there.
and,
in
time,
i;m
sure
they;re
going
to
spoon-feed
you
their
own
patented
form
of
bull.
ignore
the
verbage
and
look
at
what
they;re
doing.
what
they;re
asking
you
to
do.
what
sort
of
world
they;d
have
you
build
and
how
they;re
going
to
pay
for
it.
the
fault
lies
not
with
the
mob,
who
demands
nonsense,
but
with
those
who
do
not
know
how
to
produce
anything
else.
noontime,
and
i;m
still
pushing
myself
along
the
road,
the
darkest
part
into
the
narrow
lanes,
i
can;t
stumble
or
stay
put.
someone
else
is
speaking
with
my
mouth,
but
i;m
listening
with
my
heart.
i;ve
made
shoes
for
everyone,
even
you,
while
i
go
barefoot.
she
finished
her
letter,
wondering
whether
she
had
said
enough
and
not
too
much,
and
sat
with
the
folded
and
sealed
letter
between
her
hands
with
something
of
her
usual
hesitation
when
she
had
taken
any
step
of
importance.
then
she
rose
quickly
and
sent
it
away.
she
felt
she
must
go
into
her
brother;s
presence,
having
fulfilled
his
wishes.
she
had
not
a
moment
for
reflection
then,
for
the
front
doorbell,
usually
so
silent,
rang
loudly,
and
in
a
moment
a
tall,
broad-shouldered,
middle-aged
man
came
into
the
room
and
went
straight
up
to
her.
the
bully

he;s

dead.
every
craft
and
every
investigation,
and
likewise
every
action
and
decision,
seems
to
aim
at
some
good;
hence
the
good
has
been
well
described
as
that
at
which
everything
aims.
however,
there
is
an
apparent
difference
among
the
ends
aimed
at.
for
the
end
is
sometimes
an
activity,
sometimes
a
product
beyond
the
activity;
and
when
there
is
an
end
beyond
the
action,
the
product
is
by
nature
better
than
the
activity.
i
got
that
sunshine
in
my
pocket,
got
that
good
soul
in
my
feet.
i
feel
that
hot

body

it
drops.

can;t

phenomenally.

as
i
suspected,
the
dining
car
of
the

express
is
quite
popular
with
the
passengers,

though
we;ve

patiently
to
be

i
get
the
feeling
we
won;t
be
eating
any

soon.

for
the

rush
to

on
the
observation
deck
located
in
the
last
carriage.
i;m
inclined
to
take
his
advice.
brother,
i;m
not
depressed
and
haven;t
lost
spirit.
life
everywhere
is
life,
life
is
in
ourselves
and
not
in
the
external.
there
will
be
people
near
me,
and
to
be
a
human
being
among
human
beings,
and
remain
one
forever,
no
matter
what
misfortunes
befall,
not
to
become
depressed,
and
not
to
falter
-
this
is
what
life
is,
herein
lies
its
task.
people
say
i;m
crazy
doing
what
i;m
doing.
well,
they
give
me
all
kinds
of
warnings
to
save
me
from
ruin.
when
i
say
that
i;m
okay,
well
they
look
at
me
kinda
strange.
surely,
you;re
not
happy
now,
you
no
longer
play
the
game.
my
whole
life
is
other
people
deciding
what;s
acceptable.
when
i
put
on
a
dress,
i
get
to
decide
what;s
silly.

never
shut
up

you;d
think
he
was

only
guy
in
the

who
had
a

the
way
he
carried
on.
one
day,
he
brought
you
down
to
the
precinct
and
he
introduced
you
around
as
a
junior
detective
to
every
cop
in
the
house.
i
mean,
you
just
loved
that.
and
then,
i
remember,
at
some
point
you
drifted
away.
man,
did
he
panic.
he
had
about
ten
detectives
looking
for
you.

finally
found
you
in

we
did
understand

mother,
she
knew
what
it;s
like
to
feel
your
entire
life
like
you;re
drowning
with
the

of
these
moments,
these
very
rare,
brief
instances,
in
which
you
suddenly
remember...
you
can
swim.

there
are
moments
that
define
a
person;s
whole

moments
in
which
everything
they
are
and
everything
they
may
possibly
become

on
a
single
decision.

and

precariously
on
the
decision
made
at
that

these
are
moments
ungoverned
by
happenstance,
untroubled
by

these
are
the
moments
in
which
a
person
earns
the
right
to
live,
or
not.
there
is
an
old
building
up
ahead.

the

you
clearly
don;t
know
who
you;re
talking
to,
so
let
me
clue
you
in.
i
am
not
in

skyler.
i
am
the
danger.
a

if
there
is
one
thing
the
history
of
evolution
has
taught
us
it;s
that
life
will
not
be
contained.
life
breaks
free,
expands
to
new
territory,
and
crashes
through
barriers,
painfully,
maybe
even
dangerously.
people
say
these
things
because
everyone
holds
fond
memories
of
their
time
in
high
school;
however,
i
doubt
that
every
high
school
student
would
want
to
remember
their
school
life
that
way.
for
example,
if
neither
studying,
nor
sports,
nor
socializing
are
of
interest
to
someone,
what
then?
i
know
you;re
into
banks
and
wall
street,
but
everyone
knows
you;re
the
final
word,
you;re
like
the
supreme
court.
all
i
want
to
do
is
protect
you
from
these

and
your
lawyers
can;t
do
that.
i
have
climbed
the

i
have
run

i
have
run,
i
have
crawled,
i
have
scaled
these

walls,
but
i
still
haven;t
found
what
i;m
looking
for.
when
you
work
as
a
spy,
it;s
easy
to
think
of
people
as
assets
-
resources
to
accomplish
a
goal
-
because
you
don;t
have
a
personal
relationship
with
an
asset.
you
don;t
care
about
an
asset.
you
don;t
miss
the
scent
of
an
asset

now
when
you

or
a

and
you
prick
a

don;t
pick
the

by
the

when
you
pick

try
to

said,
speaking
more
slowly
now,
"that
there
is
a
whole
world
of
sound
about
us
all
the
time
that
we
cannot
hear.
it
is
possible
that
up
there
in
those
high-pitched
inaudible
regions
there
is
a
new
exciting
music
being
made,
with
subtle
harmonies
and
fierce
grinding
discords,
a
music
so
powerful
that
it
would
drive
us
mad
if
only
our
ears
were
tuned
to
hear
the
sound
of
it."
my
life;s
work
is
teaching.
and
i
believed
that
if
you
boys
won
that
science
fair,
got
scholarships,
went
off
and
did
something
great
with
your
lives,
somehow
my
life
would
have
counted
for
something,

you
know

sometimes
you
really
can;t
listen
to

you
just
gotta
listen
inside.

not
supposed
to

up

i

you
made

i
want
you
to

consider
all
the
things
i
have

to
become
a

of

maybe
i
haven;t
been

maybe
i;ve
been
fighting
my

they
used
to
tell
me
i
was
building

so
i
followed
the

when
there
was

plow
or
guns
to
bear,
i
was
always
there,
right
on

to
tell
me
i
was
building
a
dream
with
peace
and
glory

should
i
be
standing
in

for

i

can
you
spare

but
then
he;ll
wonder
why
i
haven;t
been

you
know
what
i;m
gonna
do?
i;m
gonna
say
that
i
was

the
real
question
is
should
i
say
that
i
have
kids?

watching
over

of

is
it

not

the
world
is
a
mess
and
i
just
need
to
rule
it.
every
single
night
i
endure
the
fight
of
little
wings
of
white-flamed
butterflies
in
my
brain.
these
ideas
of
mine
percolate
the
mind,
trickle
down
the
spine,
swarm
the
bell,
swellin;
to
a
blaze.
that;s
when
the
pain
comes
in
like
a
second
skeleton
trying
to
fit
beneath
the
skin.
i
can;t
fit
the
feelings
in.
every
single
night
is
a
fight
with
my
brain.
i
am
sitting
in
a
room,
different
from
the
one
you
are
in
now.
i
am
recording
the
sound
of
my
speaking
voice,
and
i
am
going
to
play
it
back
into
the
room
again
and
again,
until
the
resonant
frequencies
of
the
room
reinforce
themselves,
so
that
any
semblance
of
my
speech,
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
rhythm,
is
destroyed.
what
you
will
hear
then
are
the
natural
resonant
frequencies
of
the
room
articulated
by
speech.
i
regard
this
activity
not
so
much
as
a
demonstration
of
a
physical
fact,
but
more
as
a
way
to
smooth
out
any
irregularities
my
speech
might
have.

the

a
man
who
doesn;t
spend
time
with
his
family
can
never
be
a
real
man.
she
takes
care
of
herself,
she
can
wait
if
she
wants,
she;s
ahead
of
her
time.
oh,
and
she
never
gives
out
and
she
never
gives
in.
she
just
changes
her
mind.
it
was
as
if
that
great
rush
of
anger
had
washed
me
clean,
emptied
me
of
hope,
and,
gazing
up
at
the
dark
sky
spangled
with
its
signs
and
stars,
for
the
first
time,
the
first,
i
laid
my
heart
open
to
the
benign
indifference
of
the
universe.
i
didn;t
know
the
girl,
but
i
knew
her
family.
all
their
lives
were
shattered
in
a
nightmare
of
brutality.
they
try
to
carry
on,
try
to
bear
the
agony;
try
to
hold
some
faith
in
the
goodness
of
humanity.
a
real
artist
must
never
be
afraid
of
what
other
people
are
gonna
say
about
him.
in
the
wild
lands
beyond
bree
there
were
mysterious
wanderers.
the
bree-folk
called
them
rangers,
and
knew
nothing
of
their
origin.
they
were
taller
and
darker
than
the
men
of
bree
and
were
believed
to
have
strange
powers
of
sight
and
hearing,
and
to
understand
the
languages
of
beasts
and
birds.
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
world
is
like
a
calm
pond,
and
that
any
time
a
person
does
even
the
smallest
thing,
it
is
as
if
a
stone
has
dropped
into
the
pond,
spreading
circles
of
ripples
further
and
further
out,
until
the
entire
world
has
been
changed
by
one
tiny
action,
but
the
baudelaires
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
tiny
action
of
the
trigger
of
the
harpoon
gun,
or
how
the
world
changed
in
just
one
instant.
instead,
they
frantically
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
as
the
sub-sub-librarian
began
to
sink.
klaus
grabbed
one
hand,
and
sunny
grabbed
the
other,
and
violet
reached
for
his
face,
as
if
she
were
comforting
someone
who
had
begun
to
cry.
being
polite
is
not
only
the
right
way
to
respond
to
people
but
also
the
easiest.
life
is
so
filled
with
unavoidable
conflict
that
i
see
no
reason
to
promote
more
confrontations.
they
say
truth
is
the
first
casualty
of
war.
but
who
defines
what;s
true?
truth
is
just
a
matter
of
perspective.
the
duty
of
every
soldier
is
to
protect
the
innocent,
and
sometimes
that
means
preserving
the
lie
of
good
and
evil
-
that
war
isn;t
just
natural
selection
played
out
on
a
grand
scale.
the
only
truth
i
found
is
that
the
world
we
live
in
is
a
giant
tinderbox.
all
it
takes...
is
someone
to
light
the
match.
what
really
counted
was
the
possibility
of
escape,
a
leap
of
freedom,
out
of
the
implacable
ritual,
a
wild
run
for
it
that
would
give
whatever
chance
for
hope
there
was.
of
course,
hope
meant
being
cut
down
on
some
street
corner,
as
you
ran
like
mad,
by
a
random
bullet.
but
when
i
really
thought
it
through,
nothing
was
going
to
allow
me
such
a
luxury.
everything
was
against
it;
i
would
just
be
caught
up
in
the
machinery
again.
life
is
a
comedy
for
those
who
think
and
a
tragedy
for
those
who
feel.
i
wrote
him
back
a
letter
and
i
told
him
it
was
not
the
perfect
country
and
western
song,
because
he
hadn;t
said
anything
at
all
about
mama,
or
trains,
or
trucks,
or
prison,
or
gettin;
drunk.
well,
he
sat
down
and
wrote
another
verse
to
this
song
and
he
sent
it
to
me,
and
after
reading
it
i
realized
that
my
friend
had
written
the
perfect
country
and
western
song,
and
i
felt
obliged
to
include
it
on
this
album.
the
last
verse
goes
like
this
here.
well,
i
was
drunk
the
day
my
mom
got
out
of
prison,
and
i
went
to
pick
her
up
in
the
rain.
but
before
i
could
get
to
the
station
in
my
pickup
truck,
she
got
runned
over
by
a
damned
old
train.
and
i
said,
i
don;t
care
if
they
lay
me
off
either,
because
i
told
bill
that
if
they
move
my
desk
one
more
time,
then
i;m
quitting,
i;m
going
to
quit.
they;ve
moved
my
desk
four
times
already
this
year,
and
i
used
to
be
over
by
the
window,
and
i
could
see
the
squirrels,
and
they
were
married,
but
then,
they
switched
from
the
swingline
to
the
boston
stapler,
but
i
kept
my
swingline
stapler.
it
was
love
at
first
sight,
at
last
sight,
at
ever
and
ever
sight.
if
you
ever
looked
at
me
once
with
what
i
know
is
in
you,
i
would
be
your
slave.
you
fill
up
my
senses
like
a
night
in
the
forest,
like
the
mountains
in
springtime,
like
a
walk
in
the
rain,
like
a
storm
in
the
desert,
like
a
sleepy
blue
ocean.
with
your
feet
on
the
air
and
your
head
on
the
ground,
try
this
trick
and
spin
it,
yeah.
your
head
will
collapse,
but
there;s
nothing
in
it,
and
you;ll
ask
yourself
"where
is
my
mind?"
a
guy
like
me
should
never
be
allowed
to
get
in
here
in
the
first
place.
i
know
that!
and
i
hate
to
stand
here
and
try
your
patience
like
this,
but
either
i;m
dead
right
or
i;m
crazy!
it
was
night
again.
the
waystone
inn
lay
in
silence,
and
it
was
a
silence
of
three
parts.
the
most
obvious
part
was
a
hollow,
echoing
quiet,
made
by
things
that
were
lacking.
if
there
had
been
a
wind
it
would
have
sighed
through
the
trees,
set
the
inn;s
sign
creaking
on
its
hooks,
and
brushed
the
silence
down
the
road
like
trailing
autumn
leaves.
if
there
had
been
a
crowd,
even
a
handful
of
men
inside
the
inn,
they
would
have
filled
the
silence
with
conversation
and
laughter,
the
clatter
and
clamor
one
expects
from
a
drinking
house
during
the
dark
hours
of
night.
if
there
had
been
music...
but
no,
of
course
there
was
no
music.
in
fact
there
were
none
of
these
things,
and
so
the
silence
remained.
our
attempts
to
succeed
in
life
will
be
largely
determined
by
our
confidence.
this
rests
on
the
way
we
see
ourselves,
what
we
believe
about
ourselves,
what
we
believe
we
are
capable
of.
a
water
snake
glided
smoothly
up
the
pool,
twisting
its
periscope
head
from
side
to
side;
and
it
swam
the
length
of
the
pool
and
came
to
the
legs
of
a
motionless
heron
that
stood
in
the
shadows.
a
silent
head
and
beak
lanced
down
and
plucked
it
out
by
the
head,
and
the
beak
swallowed
the
little
snake
while
its
tail
waved
frantically.
you
have
an
urgent
look
about
you...
has
something
happened?
whatever
it
is,
from
the
look
on
your
face
i
suspect
that
it
is
no
laughing
matter.
by
what
right
do
you
dare
say
that
there;s
a
superior
few
to
which
you
belong?
by
what
right
did
you
dare
decide
that
that
boy
in
there
was
inferior
and
therefore
could
be
killed?
did
you
think
you
were

is
that
what
you

when
you

i
don;t

what

i
know
what
you;ve
done.

i
mean,
how
do
you
feel
about
that?
all
right,
we;re
not
doing
this,
gentlemen.
we;re
not
gonna
do
this.
we;re
not
gonna
go
bouncing
off
the
walls
for
the
next
ten
minutes,
;cause
we;re
just
gonna
end
up
right
back
here
with
the
same
problems!
try
to
figure
out
how
to
stay
alive!
i;ve
begun
to
realize
that
you
can
listen
to
silence
and
learn
from
it.
it
has
a
quality
and
a
dimension
all
its
own.
everyone;s
creeping
up
to
the
money
god,
putting
tongues
where
they
didn;t
ought
to
be.
on
stepping
stones
of
human
hearts
and
souls,
into
the
land
of
"nothing
for
free".
well
the
way
that
we;re
living
is
all
take
and
no
giving.
there;s
nothing
to
believe
in.

loudest
mouth
will
hail
the
newfound
way
to
be

for
a
day.

colorful

their
mistakes
are
hidden
from
each
other,
tucked
away
between
the
folds
of

safe.
we;re
always
thinking
of
eternity
as
an
idea
that
cannot
be
understood,
something
immense.
but
why
must
it
be?
what
if,
instead
of
all
this,
you
suddenly
find
just
a
little
room
there,
something
like
a
village
bath-house,
grimy,
and
spiders
in
every
corner,
and
that;s
all
eternity
is.
sometimes,
you
know,
i
can;t
help
feeling
that
that;s
what
it
is.
one
of
the
hardest
things
to
do
in
a
fight
is
to
make
it
look
like
you;re
trying
to
kill
someone
without
doing
any
permanent
damage.
they
don;t
teach
any
half-moves
in
combat
training.
there
are
moves
designed
to
kill
and
maim
as
efficiently
as
possible.
if
those
are
off
limits,
one
option
is
open
your
fist
right
before
a
punch
lands.
painful,
but
the
force
is
distributed.
another
showy
option
is
a
kick
to
the
shoulder.
you
might
break
a
rib
or
two,
but
if
you
aim
right,
nobody
is
going
to
the
morgue.
i
just
have
a
little
question
here.
you
could
be
a
janitor
anywhere.
why
did
you
work
at
the
most
prestigious
technical
college
in
the
whole
world?
and
why
did
you
sneak
around
at
night
and
finish
other
people;s
formulas
that
only
one
or
two
people
in
the
world
could
do
and
then
lie
about
it?
;cause
i
don;t
see
a
lot
of
honor
in
that,
will.
but
as
our
culture
has
transformed
from
one
that
was
fundamentally
based
on
internal
memories
to
one
that
is
fundamentally
based
on
memories
stored
outside
the
brain,
what
are
the
implications
for
ourselves
and
our
society?
what
we;ve
gained
is
indisputable.
but
what
have
we
traded
away?
it;s
freeing
to
know,
it;s
all
up
to
me,
who
i
choose
to
be,
what
i
choose
to
leave.
this
miracle
that
we
get
to
witness,
this
pause
in
the
chaos,
it;s
love.
this
speck
in
a
galaxy,
dot
in
a
sunbeam,
it;s
more
than
enough.
you
gotta
realize
your
worth,
you;re
meant
to
be
on
this
earth.
think
about
how
many
miracles
lead
to
your
birth.
don;t
put
a
lock
on
your
mind,
life
is
yet
to
be
defined.
beauty
in
the
unknown,
for
a
human
this
is
home.
how
could
you
possibly
see
anything
in
here
with
that
big
hat
over

than

met,
he

i;ve
had
this
knife
of
mine
for
nineteen
years
and
i;ve
cut
up
thousands
of
oxen
with
it,
and
yet
the
blade
is
as
good
as
though
it
had
just
come
out
of
the
grindstone.
there
are
spaces
between
the
joints,
and
the
blade
of
the
knife
has
really
no
thickness.
if
you
insert
what
has
no
thickness
into
such
spaces,
then
there;s
plenty
of
room
-
more
than
enough
for
the
blade
to
play
about
it.
that;s
why
after
nineteen
years
the
blade
of
my
knife
is
still
as
good
as
when
it
first
came
from
the
grindstone.

me
if
you
can,
i;m
feeling
down

i
am
not
unmindful
that
some
of
you
have
come
here
out
of
great
trials

tribulations.
some
of
you
have
come
fresh
from
narrow
cells.
some
of
you

come
from
areas
where
your
quest
for
freedom
left
you
battered
by
the
storms

persecution
and
staggered
by
the
winds
of
police

veterans
of

is
a

i

once
and
i

it
over
to
comfort
myself
in
these
times

i
have
been
told
of
a
certain
sea
snake
which
has
a
very
unusual
method
of
attracting
its
prey.
it
will
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
as
if
wounded.
then
its
enemies
will
approach,
and
yet
it
will
lie
quite
still.
and
then
its
enemies
will
take
little
bites
of
it,
and
yet
it
remains
still.
when
a
child
enters
school
for
the
first
time
he
will
encounter
many
things
with
which
he
is
unfamiliar.
the
schoolroom
desk,
some
of
the
tables
and
cabinets,
the
blackboards,

equipment

him.
i;ve
been
quite
open
about
this
around
the
office:
i
don;t
want
this
parks
department
to
build
any
parks,
because
i
don;t
believe
in
government.
i
think
that
all
government
is
a
waste
of
taxpayer
money.
my
dream
is
to
have
the

system
privatized

run
entirely
for

it
can
be
devastating.
love
can
change
us
for
life
like
nothing
else.
can
the
ancient
wisdom
be
a
fit
guide
for
us
here?
the
answer
is
yes,
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
human
emotions
do
not
change
as
centuries
pass;
the
other
is
the
fact
that
this
wisdom
is
based
on
a
profound
belief
that
the
cosmos
exists
because
of
love.

know
what
you
want.
you

that
won;t
make
you

one
of

god
is
full
of

he
has
given
all
his
children
power

you;ve
undoubtedly
noticed
how
some
authors
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
build
up
great
tension
a
few
pages
before
the
end
of
their
stories
-

a
reader
who
is
holding
the
book
physically
in
his
hands
can
feel
that
the
story
is
about
to
end.
hence,
he
has
some
extra
information
which
acts
as
an

do
you
know
what
you
do
with
all
that
pain?
shall
i
tell
you
where
you
put
it?
you
hold
it
tight
till
it
burns
your

and
you
say
this.
no

but
we;ve
drawn
so
many
pictures
of
it,
so
many
years,
trying
to
pin
it
down,
comprehend
it,
we;ve
got
to
thinking
of
it
as
an
entity,
strangely
alive
and
greedy.
all
it
is,
however,
is
a
stopped
watch,
a
loss,
an
end,

darkness.

it

low

still

well.
the
more
i
see
of
the
world,
the
more
am
i
dissatisfied
with
it;
and
every
day
confirms
my
belief
of
the

of
the
little

insects
may
carry
the
germs
or
parasites
which
cause
disease
in
a
purely
mechanical
or
accidental
way,
that
is,
the
insect
may
in
the
course
of
its
wanderings
or
its
feeding
get
some
of
the
germs
on
or
in
its
body
and
may
by
chance
carry
these
to
the
food,
or
water,
or
directly
to
some
person
who
may
become
infected.
thus
the
house-fly
may
carry
the

on

in

distribute

they

no,
i
don;t
want
to
debate
about
it,

shall
come

desmond?
i
heard
your
name
once
before
desmond,
a
long
time
ago.
and
now
it
lingers
in
my
mind
like
an
image
from
an
old
dream.
i
do
not
know
where
you
are,
or
by
what
means
you
can
hear
me.
but
i
know
you
are
listening.
i
have
lived
my
life
as
best
i
could,
not
knowing
its
purpose,
but
drawn
forward
like
a
moth
to
a
distant
moon.
and
here,
at
last,
i
discover
a
strange
truth.
that
i
am
only
a
conduit
for
a
message
that
eludes
my
understanding.
who
are
we,
who
have
been
so
blessed
to
share
our
stories
like
this?
to
speak
across
centuries?
maybe
you
will
answer
all
the
questions
i
have
asked.
maybe
you
will
be
the
one
to
make
all
this
suffering
worth
something
in
the
end.
i;m
not
proud,
i
was
wrong
and
the
truth
is
hard
to
take.
i
felt
sure
we
had
enough,
but
our
love

i;ve
been
trying
to

waves
of

keep
drowning
me.
the
future
is
something
which
everyone
reaches
at
the
rate
of
sixty
minutes

hour,
whatever
he
does,

he

all
man;s
miseries
derive
from
not
being
able
to
sit
quietly
in
a
room
alone.
have
you
heard
the
story
of
the
guy
who
decided
not
to
die?
he
figured
living
was
just
easier
than
falling
really
high.
his
son
heard
about
it
later,
thought,
"maybe
that
is
why
i;m
enamored
with
the
thought
of
seeing
angels
in
the
sky
that
are
singing."
and
they;re
singing,
saying,
"everything;s
all
right."
i
haven;t
heard
that
on
earth,
so
maybe
i
will
find
a
place
to
sleep;
just
a
comfortable
place
to
lay
my
head.
through
these
fields
of
destruction,
baptisms
of
fire,
i;ve
witnessed
your
suffering
as
the
battle
raged
higher.
and
though
they
did
hurt
me
so
bad
in
the
fear
and
alarm
you
did
not
desert
me,
my
brothers
in
arms.
will
you
wait
a
minute,
i
didn;t
say
that.
i;m
only
happy
because
the
guy
can;t
bowl
no
more.
that;s
all.
see,
i;m
waiting
six
years
to
get
a
spot
on
this
special
bowling
team,
and
now
there;s
a
spot
opened
up.
i;m
sorry
the
guy
is
dead,
but
that;s
life.
in
the
moment
when
i
truly
understand
my
enemy,
understand
him
well
enough
to
defeat
him,
then
in
that
very
moment
i
also
love
him.
i
think
it;s
impossible
to
really
understand
somebody,
what
they
want,
what
they
believe,
and
not
love
them
the
way
they
love
themselves.
and
then,
in
that
very
moment
when
i
love
them...
i
destroy
them.
there
will
come
a
dawn
or
sunset
or
high
noon
when
a
man
will
take
my
life
in
battle
too
-
flinging
a
spear
perhaps,
or
whipping
a
deadly
arrow
off
his
bow.
come
on,
kid,
don;t
fool
around.
just
let
your
hand
drop
to
your
side
and
the
gun
slip
out.
everyone
will
still
think
you;ve
got
it.
they;re
gonna
be
staring
at
your
face,
mike.
so
walk
out
of
the
place
real
fast,
but
you
don;t
run.
don;t
look
nobody
directly
in
the
eye,
but
don;t
look
away
either.
they;re
gonna
be
scared
of
you,
believe
me,
so
don;t
worry
about
nothing.
always!
that
is
a
dreadful
word.
it
makes
me
shudder
when
i
hear
it.
women
are
so
fond
of
using
it.
they
spoil
every
romance
by
trying
to
make
it
last
for
ever.
it
is
a
meaningless
word,
too.
the
only
difference
between
a
caprice
and
a
life-long
passion
is
that
the
caprice
lasts
a
little
longer.
i
think
a
lot
about
the
way
it
ends
-
the
kind
of
things
no
one
ever
wants
me
to
say
again.
but
the
line;s
in
my
mind
so
when
i
peace
i;ll
know
i
had
the
best
times,
with
the
greatest
friends.
that;s
why
i
own
it,
live
in
the
moment,
trying
to
make
the
most
of
it,
notice
the
unnoticed.
and
any
stacks
that
i
stack,
well
that;s
a
bonus,
i;ve
seen
too
many
dull
folks
working
the
wrong
motives.
so
while
you;re
napping
in
the
afternoon,
i;m
in
the
classroom
raising
up
my
hand,
yes
i;m
that
dude.
i;m
in
the
cancun
sands,
just
passing
through
till
i;m
in
the
studio
booth
tracking
these
raps
too.
and
if
you;re
waiting
for
anybody
to
ask
you
where
your
passion
falls
or
what
you
have
to
do,
then
consider
this
your
call
to
be
all
you
can
be.

transformed

that

so
i
went
to
pick
up
the
snake
to
admire
it,
and
he
transformed
back
into

and
he
was
like,
"blech,
it;s

and
he
stabbed
me.

let
me
just
correct

for

mr.

entered
into

it;s
also
true

he
had

while

he

people
always
ask
me
how
can
we
charge
so
much
for
what
amounts
to
gradations
of
white.
i
tell
them
it;s
not
about
the
artist;s
name
or
the
skill
required,
not
even
about
the
art
itself.
all
that
matters
is
"how
does
it
make
you
feel?"
i;ve
always
been
afraid
that
if
i
screamed,
i
might
break
apart
in
a
million
pieces.

when
the

where
were
they

it
were
all
so
simple!
if
only
there
were
evil
people
somewhere
insidiously
committing
evil
deeds,
and
it
were
necessary
only
to
separate
them
from
the
rest
of
us
and
destroy
them.
but
the
line
dividing
good
and
evil
cuts
through
the
heart

who
is
willing
to
destroy

piece

four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent,
a
new
nation,
conceived
in
liberty,
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal.
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war,
testing
whether
that
nation,
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
dedicated,
can
long
endure.
we
are
met
on
a
great
battle-field
of
that
war.
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field,
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live.
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this.

and
before
i
had
heard
a

words,
i
would

i
lay
there,
trembling
and
listening,
in
the
extreme
of
fear
and
curiosity,
for,
in
those
dozen
words,
i
understood
that
the
lives
of
all
the
honest
men
aboard
depended
on
me
alone.

i
walked
back

something

to

i

the

dark
wind
had
been
rising
toward
me
from
somewhere
deep
in
my
future,
across
years
that
were
still
to

as

this
wind
leveled

more
real
than
the
ones
i
was

is
a
survival
trait
when
you

when
one
of

does,
at
which
point
you
feel

last
night,
i
had
a
dream
about
you.
in
this
dream
i;m
dancing
right
beside
you,
and
it
looked
like
everyone
was
having
fun;
the
kind
of
feeling
i;ve
waited
so
long.

sometimes
human
beings
have
to
just
sit
in

place

that
you
will
become
way

concerned
with
what
other
people
think
of
you
when
you
realize
how
seldom
they
do.
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
raw,
unalloyed,
agendaless

that
it
is
possible
to
fall
asleep
during

anxiety

that

on
anything
is
very
hard
work.
there
is
a
fifth
dimension
beyond
that
which
is
known
to

it
is
a
dimension
as
vast
as
space
and
as
timeless
as
infinity.
it
is
the
middle
ground
between
light
and
shadow,
between
science
and
superstition,
and
it
lies
between
the
pit
of

fears

dear
theodosia,
what
to

to
you?
you
have
my
eyes,
you
have
your
mother;s
name,
when
you
came
into
the
world
you
cried.
and
it
broke
my
heart.

dedicated
every

to
you.

i
never

anything
for

i
don;t
want
to
see

she
didn;t

i
was
in
the
room,
and
when
i
asked
her
in
a
quiet,
a
very
quiet
voice,
with
the
most
restrained
manner
possible,
what
she
was
doing
with
the
paper
-
she
turned
around
as
if
she
had
been
caught
stealing,
and
looked
quite
angry
-
asked
me
why
i
should
frighten
her
so!
then
she
said
that
the
paper
stained
everything
it
touched,
that
she
had
found
yellow
smooches
on
all
my
clothes
and
john;s,
and
she
wished
we
would
be
more
careful!

could
love
that
tractor

as
we
have
loved
this
land
when
it
was
ours.

saw
in
your
eyes
and
i
saw
the
way
you
carried
yourself
that
you;re
not
a
happy

make
my
living
off
the
evening

just
give
me
something,
something
i
can
use.

you
lose.

well,
i
coulda
been
an
actor,
but
i
wound
up
here.
i
just
have
to
look
good.
i
don;t
have
to
be
clear.
come
and
whisper
in
my
ear.
give
us
dirty
laundry.
lying
here
in
the
darkness
i
hear
the
sirens
wail.
somebody;s
going
to
emergency,
somebody;s
going
to
jail.
you
find
somebody
to
love
in
this
world,
you
better
hang
on
tooth
and
nail.
the
wolf
is
always
at
the
door.
humans
just
lead
short,
boring,
insignificant
lives,
so
they
make
up
stories
to
feel
like
they;re
a
part
of
something
bigger.
they
want
to
blame
all
the
world;s
problems
on
some
single
enemy
they
can
fight,
instead
of
a
complex
network
of
interrelated
forces
beyond
anyone;s
control.
in
my
own
case,
i
have
several
times
happened
to
overlook
results
which
ought
to
have
struck
me
blind,
as
being
immediate
consequences
of
other
ones
which
i
had
obtained.
most
of
these
proceed
from
the
cause
which
we
have
just
mentioned,
viz.,
from
attention
too
narrowly
directed.
we
found
our
way
back
to
the
city
we
came
from.
;cause
i
look
back
and
i
thought,
man
what
if
i
gave
up.
i
watched
myself
burn
and
there;s
nothing
i;m
ashamed
of,
;cause
i
found
my
new
self
and
the
fire
i;m
afraid
of.
back
then
when
i
got
home
from
work,
you
were
always
there
waiting
for
me.
and
that
was
all
i
needed.
just
you.
but
on
that
day,
when
i
came
back
home
the
only
thing
there
was
that
pocket
watch;
that
and
a
small
piece
of
paper
that
just
had
one
word
written
across
it:
farewell.
for
some
reason,
i
didn;t
feel
sad
or
broken
up
-
it
just
didn;t
seem
real.
but
slowly
i
realized
that
it
was
real;
that
you
were
gone.
and
little
by
little
i
felt
something
inside
of
me
go
numb.
after
six
months
i
made
a
kind
of
bet
with
myself;
a
pledge,
that
i
would
leave
this
planet
and
start
a
new
life
if
you
didn;t
return
by
the
time
the
watch
stopped.
i
didn;t
come
here
to
blame
you,
i...
i
just
wanted
to
know
why.
why
you
disappeared
like
that.
if
i;m
at
a
party
where
i;m
not
enjoying
myself,
i
will
put
some
cookies
in
my
jacket
pocket
and
leave
without
saying
goodbye.
it;s
like
this,
i
think:
the
excellence
of
a
good
body
doesn;t
make
the
soul
good,
but
the
other
way
around:
the
excellence
of
a
good
soul
makes
the
body
as
good
as
it
can
be.
in
order
to
face
down
the
danger
that
is
stalking
us
and
move
through
it,
we
first
have
to
recognize
that
we
are
facing
a
crisis.
so
why
is
it
that
our
leaders
seem
not
to
hear
such
clarion
warnings?
are
they
resisting
the
truth
because
they
know
that
the
moment
they
acknowledge
it,
they
will
face
a
moral
imperative
to
act?
is
it
simply
more
convenient
to
ignore
the
warnings?

you.
i
climbed
up

to

i
wandered

to

just
you.

i
have
no

i;ve

you;ve
never
looked
at

been
totally

that
could

with

for

we;re
all
bored,
we;re

so
tired

me,

is

we;re
so
young,

we;re
on
the
road
to

we
play
dumb,
but
we
know
exactly
what
we;re
doing.
you;re
gonna
blame
me
because
you
were
the
business

of
the
company
and
you
made
a
bad

for

in

i
won;t
let
sorrow
hurt
me,
not
like
it;s

me
before.
for

i
have
someone
i
know
won;t
desert
me.
i;m
not
alone
anymore.
my

is
as
a

longing
still
for

which

on

dave,
although
you
took
very
thorough
precautions
in
the
pod
against
my
hearing
you,
i
could
see
your
lips
move.
it
all
just
disappears

it?

are,

he;s

i
always

we
all
change,

you
think
about
it.
we
are
all

through
our
lives

that;s
okay
-
that;s

-
you;ve
got
to
keep
moving,
so
long
as
you
remember
all
the
people

you
used

like
happiness,
cannot
be

it

and
it
only
does
so
as
the

effect
of
one;s
personal
dedication

a
cause
greater
than

as
the
by-product
of
one;s
surrender

happen,
and
the

holds
for
success:
you
have
to
let
it
happen
by
not

the

is
the
only

it

there
is
perhaps
no
better
demonstration
of
the
folly
of
human
conceits
than
this
distant
image
of
our
tiny

to
me,
it
underscores
our
responsibility
to
deal
more
kindly

to
preserve
and
cherish

my
mom,

challenged
us
on
everything.
she;d
use
words
we
didn;t
know
in
the

of
a
sentence
and
make
us
tell
her
what
they
meant
by
figuring
out
the
context
in
which
they
were
used.
when
she
and
my
grandparents
talked
about
politics
at
the
table,
she
wanted
to
hear
our
opinions.
the
more
we
disagreed
with
her,
the
happier
she
seemed
to
be.
why
are
you
trying
so
hard
to
fit
in
when
you

i
couldn;t
forgive
him
or
like
him,
but
i
saw
that
what
he
had
done
was,
to
him,
entirely
justified.
it
was
all
very
careless
and
confused.
they
were
careless
people,
tom
and
daisy
-
they
smashed
up
things
and
creatures
and
then
retreated
back
into
their
money
or
their
vast
carelessness,
or
whatever
it
was
that
kept
them
together,
and
let
other
people
clean
up
the
mess
they
had
made.
when
i
look
into
your
eyes
i
can
see
a
love
restrained.
but
darlin;
when
i
hold
you,
don;t
you
know
i
feel
the
same?
nothin;
lasts
forever
and
we
both
know
hearts
can
change,
and
it;s
hard
to
hold
a
candle
in
the
cold
november
rain.
what
drives
me
out
of
the
apartment
to
prowl
through
the
city?
i
wander
through
the
streets
alone
-
not
the
relaxing
stroll
of
a
summer
night,
but
the
tense
hurry
to
get
-
where?
show
them
how
to
fly
away,
when
this
world
is
torn.
if
you
feel
like
dying,
lose
that
forever,
you;re
shining
and
it

the
other
night,
dear,
as
i
lay
sleeping,
i
dreamed
i
held
you
in
my
arms.
but
when
i
awoke,
dear,
i
was
mistaken,
so
i
hung
my
head
and
cried.
you
are
my
sunshine,
my
only
sunshine.
you
make
me
happy
when
skies
are
grey.
you;ll
never
know,
dear,
how
much
i
love
you.
please
don;t
take
my
sunshine
away.
i;ll
always
love
you
and
make
you
happy
if
you
will
only
say
the
same.
but
if
you
leave
me
to
love
another,
you;ll
regret
it
all
some
day.
i
look
at
you
all,
see
the
love
there
that;s
sleeping.
while
my
guitar
gently
weeps.
i
look
at
the
floor
and
i
see
it
needs
sweeping.
still
my
guitar
gently
weeps.
subatomic
penetration,
rapid
fire
through
your
skull.

i
shot
it
on
one
taking
it
back
to
the
days
of
trying
to
lose
control.

in
a
blaze
of

bones.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
gear
or
footwear
or
the
backpacking
fads
or
philosophies
of
any
particular
era
or
even
with
getting
from
point
a
to
point
b.
it
had
to
do
with
how
it
felt
to
be
in
the
wild.
with
what
it
was
like
to
walk
for
miles
with
no
reason
other
than
to
witness
the
accumulation
of
trees
and
meadows,
mountains
and
deserts,
streams
and
rocks,
rivers
and
grasses,
sunrises
and
sunsets.
the
experience
was
powerful
and
fundamental.
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
had
always
felt
like
this
to
be
a
human
in
the
wild,
and
as
long
as
the
wild
existed
it
would
always
feel
this
way.
it
is
a
capital
mistake
to
theorize
before
one
has

insensibly

begins
to
twist
facts
to
suit
theories,
instead
of
theories
to
suit
facts.

last
night
i
dreamed
of
chickens,
there
were
chickens
everywhere,
they
were
standing
on
my
stomach,
they
were
nesting
in
my
hair,
they
were
pecking
at
my
pillow,
they
were
hopping
on
my
head,
they
were
ruffling
up
their
feathers
as
they
raced
about
my
bed.
they
were
on
the
chairs
and
tables,
they
were
on
the
chandeliers,
they
were
roosting
in
the
corners,
they
were
clucking
in
my
ears,
there
were
chickens,
chickens,
chickens
for
as
far
as
i
could
see...
when
i
woke
today,
i
noticed
there
were
eggs
on
top
of
me.
the
robins
were
singing
vespers
in
the
high
tree-tops,
filling
the
golden
air
with
their
jubilant
voices.
the
silver
fluting
of
the
frogs
came
from
marshes
and
ponds,
over
fields
where
seeds
were
beginning
to
stir
with
life
and
thrill
to
the
sunshine
and
rain
that
had
drifted
over
them.
your
mother
died
to
save
you.
if
there
is
one
thing
voldemort
cannot
understand,
it
is
love.
he
didn;t
realize
love
as
powerful
as
your
mother;s
love
for
you
leaves
its
own
mark.
not
a
scar,
no
visible
sign...
to
have
been
loved
so
deeply,
even
though
the
person
who
loved
us
is
gone,
will
give
us
some
protection
forever.
it
is
in
your
very
skin.
quirrell,
full
of
hatred,
greed
and
ambition,
sharing
his
soul
with
voldemort,

not
touch
you
for
this
reason.
it
was
agony
to
touch
a
person
marked
by
something
so
good.
there;s
an
old
man
called
the
mississippi,
that;s
the
old
man
that
i;d
like
to
be!

does
he
care
if
the
world;s
got
troubles?
what
does
he
care
if
the
land
ain;t
free?
old
man
river,
that
old
man
river,
he
must
know
something
but
don;t
say
nothing.
he
just
keeps
rolling,
he
keeps
on
rolling
along.
he
don;t
plant
taters,
he
don;t
plant
cotton,
and
them
that
plants

is
soon

but

he
just
keeps

some
questions
about
the
fish
that
aureliano
could
not
answer
because
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
attack
of
asthma.
he
wanted
to
stay
beside
that
skin
forever,
beside
those
emerald
eyes,
close
to
that
voice
that
called
him
"sir"
with
every
question,
showing
the
same
respect
that
she
gave
her
father.
they;re
called
thestrals,
they;re
quite
gentle
really.
but
people
avoid
them
because
they;re
a
bit...
different.
they
can
only
be
seen
by
people
who
have
seen
death.
i
could
tell
you
i
was
fragile.
i
could
tell
you
i
was
weak.
i
could
write
you
out
a
letter.
tell
you
anything
you
need.
i;ve
seen
minutes
turn
to
hours.
hours
turn
to
years.
and
i;ve
seen
truth
turn
to
power.
if
you
could
see
me
the
way
i
see
you.
if
you
could
feel
me
the
way
i
feel
you.
you;d
be
a
believer.
you;d
be
a
believer.
minutes
turn
to
hours.
hours
turn
to
years.
and
i;ve
seen
truth
turn
to
power.
to
understand
what
i;m
about
to
tell
you,
you
need
to
do
something
first,
you
need
to
believe
in
the
impossible.
can
you
do
that?
good.
because
all
of
us,
we;ve
forgotten
what
miracles
look
like.
maybe
because
they
haven;t
made
much
of
an
appearance
lately.
our
lives
have
become
ordinary.
but
there
is
someone
out
there
who
is
truly
extraordinary.
i
don;t
know
where
you
came
from,
i
don;t
know
your
name,
but
i
have
seen
you
do
the
impossible
to
protect
the
city
i
love.
so
for
those
of
us
who
believe
in
you
and
what
you;re
doing,
i
just
want
to
say
thank
you.
so
i;ve
spent
the
last
few
months
running
down
leads,
trying
to
back
up
his
story,
and
he;s
right
about
one
thing:
there
are
dirty
cops.
a
lot
of
them.
but
did
they
set
him
up?
i...
i
thought
maybe
they
had.
and
then,
uh,
yesterday,
your
father
confessed
to
the
murder.
i
tried
to
talk
to
him,
but
all
anyone
will
tell
me
is
that
he
turned
state;s
evidence
and
that
you,
your
mom
and
i
are
being
placed
into
witness
protection.
i
could
see
why
some
of
the
boys
took
him
for
snobby.
he
had
a
quiet
way
about
him,
a
walk
and
a
talk
that
just
wasn;t
normal
around
here.
he
strolled,
like
a
man
in
a
park
without
a
care
or
a
worry
in
the
world,
like
he
had
on
an
invisible
coat
that
would
shield
him
from
this
place.
yeah,
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say...
i
liked
andy
from
the
start.
i;m
not
exactly
sure
what
happened.
sometimes
i
remember
it
one
way,
sometimes
another...
if
i;m
going
to
have
a
past,
i
prefer
it
to
be
multiple
choice!
without
a
queen

by
helping
you,
perhaps
i
was
trying
to
lift
up
my
own
life
a
trifle.
i
figured
i
could
get
a
job
at
a
filling
station
somewhere,
putting
gas
and
oil
in
people;s
cars.
i
didn;t
care
what
kind
of
job
it
was,
though.
just
so
people
didn;t
know
me
and
i
didn;t
know
anybody.

i
used
to
kid
her
once
in
a
while
because
she
wouldn;t
take
her

out
of
the

but
i
didn;t
kid
her
much
though.
you
never
wanted
to
kid
jane
too
much.
i
think
i
really
like
it
best
when
you
can
kid
the
pants
off
a
girl
when
the
opportunity
arises,
but
it;s
a
funny
thing.
the
girls
i
like
best
are
ones
i
never
feel
much
like
kidding.
sometimes
i
think
they;d
like
it
if
you
kidded
them
-
in
fact
i
know
they
would
-
but
it;s
hard
to
get
started,

you;ve
known

a
pretty
long
time
and
never
kidded
them.

so
much
vigilance

moral
strength
that
many
succumbed
to
the

invented
by
themselves,
which
was
less
practical
for
them
but
more
comforting.
i;ve
got
you

my

i
have
got
you
deep
in
the
heart

me,
so
deep
in

that
you;re
really
a
part
of
me.
i;ve
got
you

you;ve
beaten
my

which
means
you;re
exceptionally
strong
so
you
could;ve
put
the
poison
in
your

trusting
on
your
strength
to
save
you
so
i
can
clearly
not
choose
the
wine
in

of
you.
but
you;ve
also
bested
my
spaniard,
which
means
you
must
have
studied
and
in
studying
you
must
have
learned
that
man
is
mortal
so
you
would
have
put
the
poison
as
far
from

possible

i
can

not

we
will
change
all
that.
when
our
mission
is

no

will
the

by
the

of
these
two
fools!
no

we

this.
we
will
stop
them
now!
brothers
and
sisters,
are
we
ready?
i
will
not
be

by
this
anymore!
it
will
take
more
than
head

to
stop
me.
you
may
have
invaded
my
mind
and
my
body...
but
there;s
one
thing
a
saiyan
always
keeps:
his
pride!
every
moment
there
are
a
million
miracles
happening
around
you:
a
flower
blossoming,
a
bird
tweeting,
a
bee
humming,
a
raindrop
falling,
a
snowflake
wafting
along
the
clear
evening
air.
there
is
magic
everywhere.
if
you
learn
how
to
live
it,
life
is
nothing
short
of
a
daily
miracle.
it
was
lunch
time
and
mother
decided
we
were
going
to
have
a
picnic
right
there
on
the
attic
floor.
i
remember
helping
her
spread
the
rug,
laying
out
plates
of
sandwiches
cut
into
triangles,
slices
of
sweet
yellow
mango,
cartons
of
juice,
crackers.
there
was
coffee
in
a
flask
for
mother
and
warm
creamy
chocolate
for
me
in
a
beaker.
it
now
becomes
clear
that
consistency
is
not
a
property
of
a
formal
system
per
se,
but
depends
on
the
interpretation
which
is
proposed
for
it.
by
the
same
token,
inconsistency
is
not
an
intrinsic
property
of
any
formal
system.
you
know
what
really

denied
the
right

you
won;t

us
give
up
and
no
matter
what
we

when
you
say
we
can;t
give
up,
you;re
not

-
you;re
strong-arming
us!

have
looked
down

i
have
passed
by
the

on

dropped
my

unwilling
to

i
have
stood

though
we
did
not
choose
to
be
of

it
would
seem
that
we
are
here
to

if
you
approach
this
planet
with
hostile
intent,
know
this:
we
will
defend
ourselves.
we
will
defend

we
will
defend...

the
fact
that
we
live
at
the

of

deep
gravity

on
the
surface
of
a
gas
covered
planet
going
around
a
nuclear
fireball
90
million
miles
away
and
think
this
to
be
normal
is
obviously
some
indication
of
how
skewed
our
perspective
tends
to
be.
i
guess
this
time
you;re
really
leaving.
i
heard
your
suitcase
say
goodbye.
well,
as
my
broken
heart
lies
bleeding

you;ve
cried

and
now
you;re
swimming
for
the

left
me
drowning
in
my
tears
and
you
won;t
save
me
anymore.
i;m
just
sitting
here

the

go
round
and
round.
i
really
love
to
watch
them

i
just
had
to
let

no
mistake
about
people
who
leap
from
burning
windows.
their
terror
of
falling
from
a
great
height
is
still
just
as
great
as
it
would
be
for
you
or
me
standing
speculatively
at
the
same
window
just
checking
out
the
view;
i.e.
the
fear
of
falling
remains
a
constant.
the
variable
here
is
the
other
terror,
the
fire;s
flames:
when
the
flames
get
close
enough,
falling
to
death
becomes
the
slightly
less
terrible
of
two
terrors.
it;s
not
desiring
the
fall;
it;s
terror
of
the
flames.
it
is

who
have
a
difficult
time

our
attention.
i
know
the
more

this
as
something
rather
beneath
you.

i

you
that
listening
to
the

americans
is
beneath
no

surely
not

my

now
i
hear
the
voice
of
a
conscience,
and
it;s
terrifying,
because
for
the
first
time
it;s
my
voice.
i

you

never!
never!
what
we;ve
got
here
is
failure
to

men
you
just
can;t

you

what
we

-

don;t

than
you

a
fool
you
are.
i;m
a
god,
how
can
you
kill
a
god?
what
a
grand
and

innocence.
how
could
you
be
so
naive?
there
is
no
escape.
no
recall
or
intervention
can
work
in
this
place.
come,
lay
down
your
weapons,
it
is
not
too
late
for
my
mercy.
just
as
i;m
giving
up,
my
heart
is
palpitating.
here
comes
another
one,
it;s
so
intoxicating.
and
being
where
i;ve
been,
i
know
that
in
the
end
i;ll
do
it
all
again.
when
i
look
up
from
my
pillow,
i
dream
you
are
there
with
me.
though
you
are
far
away,
i
know
you;ll
always
be
near
to
me.
a
problem
in
communication
is
that
people
don;t
smile
enough.
watch
them
on
the
street,
at
the
office
or
even
at
home.
how
often
do
they
smile?
some
turn
a
smile
on
and
off
like
a
switch
and
use
it
to
impress
others.
but
their
insincerity
is
quite
obvious
to
the
onlooker.
you
know
what?
i
am
very
comfortable
with
my
mind
-
thoughts
clean
and
unclean,
loving
and...
the
opposite
of
that.
but
i
am
not
a
woman,
and
i
think
it
behooves
any
man
to
toss
all
female
troubles
into
the
hands
of
a
stranger.
it;s
hard
to
believe
that
twenty
years
ago
there
were
no
personal
computers.
now
it;s
the
third
largest
industry
in
the
world,
somewhere
between
energy
production
and
illegal
drugs,
but
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
is
that
it
happened
by
accident
because
a
bunch
of
disenfranchised
nerds
wanted
to
impress
their
friends.
i
just
thought
i;d
say
thank
you
for
doin;
a
great
job.
so
i
thought
i;d
let
you
stay
with
me.
i
mean,
not
with
me!
but
there.
not
with
me
there!
but
there
in
your
own
cozy
cone.
and
i;d
be
in
my
cone.
this
is
the
world
that
you
know.
the
world
as
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century.

exists
now
only
as
part
of
a
neural
interactive
simulation
that
we
call
the
matrix.

been
living
in
a
dream
world,

this
is
the

it
exists
today.

to

desert
of
the

don;t
think
we;d
have
any
alternatives.

a
single

if
he
were
proven
to

i
wouldn;t
see
how
we;d
have
any
choice
but
disconnection.
i
should
have
died
that
day.
but
i
didn;t.
i
dragged
my
wounded
body
and
reached
ground
zero
of
the
nuclear
detonations.
a
barren,
empty
land.
i
felt
an
unbearable
sadness
when
i
witnessed
that
landscape.
there
were
still
people
living
there.
they
were
the
ones
that
saved
me.
it
may
be
true
that
the
world
has
no
need
of
borders.
but
would
getting
rid
of
them
really
change
anything?
the
world
won;t
change
for
the
better
unless
we
trust
people.
trust
is
vital
in
a
peaceful
world.
but
that
will
never
happen.
i;m
still
on
the
battlefield.
right
now
i;m
near
a
border.
i
want
to
see
for
myself
what
borders
really
mean
and
what
their
volition
really
is.
i
may
not
find
what
i;m
looking
for,
but
i
still
want
to
try.
anyway,
that;s
what
i;ve
come
to
believe,
and
i
think
that;s
enough.
i
thought
climbing
the
devil;s
thumb
would
fix
all
that
was
wrong
with
my
life.
in
the
end,
of
course,
it
changed
almost
nothing.
but
i
came
to
appreciate
that
mountains
make
poor
receptacles
for
dreams.
and
i
lived
to
tell
my
tale.

the
searchlights
in
the
parking
lots
of
hell.
oh
i;m
sure
that;s
exactly
what
you
want
these
people
to
believe.
you
know
something,
bender?
you
ought
to
spend
a
little
more
time
trying
to
do
something
with
yourself
and
a
little
less
time
trying
to
impress
people.
you
might
be
better
off.
all
right,
that;s
it!
i;m
going
to
be
right
outside
those
doors!
the
next
time
i
have
to
come
in
here,
i;m
crackin;
skulls!
to
an
outsider;s
ear
it
sounds
absurdly
wild
and
ridiculous
to
speak
of
the
vocation
of
a
thief.
however,
i
venture
to
assure
you
that
this
vocation
is
a
reality.
don;t
bother
trying
to
explain
your
emotions.
live
everything
as
intensely
as
you
can
and
keep
whatever
you
felt
as
a
gift
from
god.
the
best
way
to
destroy
the
bridge
between
the
visible
and
invisible
is
by
trying
to
explain
your
emotions.
most
localities
haven;t
found
a
better
way
to
de-ice
roadways
and
sidewalks
than
salt.
salt
is
also
effective
in
keeping
hard
packs
of
ice
from
forming
in
the
first
place.
while
a
number
of
chemicals
have
been
developed
to
melt
ice,
salt
remains
a
much
cheaper
alternative.
you
didn;t
just
have
faith
in
paine
or
any
other
living
man.
you
had
faith
in
something
bigger
than
that.
you
had
plain,
decent,
everyday,
common
rightness,
and
this
country
could
use
some
of
that.
yeah,
so
could
the
whole
cockeyed
world,
a
lot
of
it.
remember
the
first
day
you
got
here?
remember
what
you
said
about
mr.
lincoln?
you
said
he
was
sitting
up
there,
waiting
for
someone
to
come
along.
you
were
right.
he
was
waiting
for
a
man
who
could
see
his
job
and
sail
into
it,
that;s
what
he
was
waiting
for.
a
man
who
could
tear
into
the
taylors
and
root
them
out
into
the
open.
i
think
he
was
waiting
for
you,
jeff.
he
knows
you
can
do
it,
so
do
i.
for
the
sake
of
all
that
we
ourselves
hold
dear,
is
it
unthinkable
that
we
should
refuse
to
meet
the
challenge?
it
is
to
this
high
purpose
that
i
now
call
my
people
at
home,
and
my
peoples
across
the
seas,
who
will
make
our
cause
their
own.
i
ask
them
to
stand
calm
and
firm
and
united
in
this
time
of
trial.
the
task
will
be
hard.
there
may
be
dark
days
ahead,
and
war
can
no
longer
be
confined
to
the
battlefield,
but
we
can
only
do
the
right
as
we
see
the
right,
and
reverently
commit
our
cause
to
god.
if
one
and
all
we
keep
resolutely
faithful
to
it,
then,
with
god;s
help,
we
shall
prevail.
even
the
best-designed
chair
won;t
make
up
for
bad
posture.
bad
posture
is
the
root
of
many
physical
problems.
so
sit
upright
and
don;t
slouch.
your
back
should
be
straight
to
support
the
upper
part
of
your
body.
the
time
has
come
for
man
to
set
himself
a
goal.
the
time
has
come
for
man
to
plant
the
seed
of
his
highest
hope.
his
soil
is
still
rich
enough.
but
one
day
this
soil
will
be
poor
and
domesticated,
and
no
tall
tree
will
be
able
to
grow
in
it.
you
know
how
you
throw
your
jacket
on
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
day?
well,
like
that
-
only,
instead
of
a
chair,
it;s
a
pile
of
garbage.
and
instead
of
a
jacket,
it;s
a
pile
of
garbage.
and
instead
of
the
end
of
the
day,
it;s
the
end
of
time
and
garbage
is
all
that
has
survived!
pain
and
suffering
are
always
inevitable
for
a
large
intelligence
and
a
deep
heart.
the
really
great
men
must,
i
think,
have
great
sadness
on
earth.
i
walked
awhile
among
the
rocks:
the
sky
was
perfectly
clear,
and
the
sun
so
hot,
that
i
was
forced
to
turn
my
face
from
it:
when
all
of
a
sudden
it
became
obscure,
as
i
thought,
in
a
manner
very
different
from
what
happens
by
the
interposition
of
a
cloud.
mostly,
i
could
tell,
i
made
him
feel
uncomfortable.
he
didn;t
understand
me,
and
he
was
sort
of
holding
it
against
me.
i
felt
the
urge
to
reassure
him
that
i
was
like
everybody
else,
just
like
everybody
else.
but
really
there
wasn;t
much
point,
and
i
gave
up
the
idea
out
of
laziness.
almost
as
soon
as
these
ideas
became
current,
thinkers
recognized
that
they
posed
a
serious
metaphysical
challenge.
astronomy
doesn;t
disprove
religion,
of
course,
but
it
does
present
problems
for
those
who
want
to
see
an
intelligible
message
in
the
cosmos.
read
not
to
contradict
and
confute,
nor
to
find
talk
and
discourse,
but
to
weigh
and
to
consider.
some
books
are
to
be
tasted,
others
to
be
swallowed
and
some
few
to
be
chewed
and
digested.
do
you
know
why
i
survived,
professor,
the
night
i
got
this.
because
of
her,
because
she
sacrificed
herself,
because
she
refused
to
step
aside,
because
her
love
was
more
powerful
than
voldemort.
don;t
say
his
name.
i;m
not
afraid
of
the
name,
professor.
i;m
going
to
tell
you
something,
something
others
have
only
guessed
at,
it;s
true,
i
am
the
chosen
one.
only
i
can
destroy
him,
but
to
do
so
i
need
to
know
what
tom
riddle
said
to
you
all
those
years
ago
in
your
office,
and
i
need
to
know
what
you
told
him.
be
brave,
professor,
be
brave
like
my
mother.
otherwise,
you
disgrace
her,
otherwise
she
died
for
nothing.
it
is
important
to
notice
that
tolerance
requires
work.
if
people
do
not
mind
what
others
do,
even
when
what
those
others
do
seems
strange,
alternative
and
remote,
this
is
not
tolerance;
it
is
indifference.
but
tolerance
is
an
active
thing.
it
involves
recognizing
the
right
of
others
to
be
different
from
oneself,
and
allowing
them
the
space
and
opportunity
to
speak
from
their
different
perspective
and
(under
the
usual
constraint
of
not
harming
others)
to
live
it
out.
on
a
manual
typewriter,
strike
the
key
with
a
nice
sharp
stroke
-
not
a
hard
stroke,
but
a
fast
one.
the
sound
should
be
sharp
and
quick.
if
you
are
pushing
your
keys
rather
than
striking
them,
the
sound
will
be
mushy.
so
what;s
in
this
for
you?
should
you
rush
out
in
search
of
a
mission?
should
you
quit
your
job
and
find
a
goal?
probably
not.
but
look
around
you.
you
may
be
on
a
mission,
and
not
realize
it
yet.
these
are
the
good
old
days
you;ll
look
back
on
with
pride.
you
might
as
well
enjoy
it
now.
what
do
you
do
when
there
is
an
evil
you
cannot
defeat
by
just
means?
do
you
stain
your
hands
with
evil
to
destroy
evil?
or
do
you
remain
steadfastly
just
and
righteous
even
if
it
means
surrendering
to
evil?
bad
luck,
i
guess.
it
floats
around.
it;s
got
to
land
on
somebody.
it
was
my
turn,
that;s
all.
i
was
in
the
path
of
the
tornado.
i
just
didn;t
expect
the
storm
would
last
as
long
as
it
has.
to
devise
is
the
work
of
the
master,
to
execute
the
act
of
the
servant.
a
few
light
taps
upon
the
pane
made
him
turn
to
the
window.
it
had
begun
to
snow
again.
he
watched
sleepily
the
flakes,
silver
and
dark,
falling
obliquely
against
the
lamplight.
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
set
out
on
his
journey
westward.
i
drive
by
this
place
a
lot
and
i
see
you
here.
i
see
a
lot
of
people
around
you.
the
only
people
for
me
are
the
mad
ones,
the
ones
who
are
mad
to
live,
mad
to
talk,
mad
to
be
saved,
desirous
of
everything
at
the
same
time,
the
ones
who
never
yawn
or
say
a
commonplace
thing,
but
burn,
burn,
burn,
like
fabulous
yellow
roman
candles
exploding
like
spiders
across
the
stars,
and
in
the
middle,
you
see
the
blue
center-light
pop,
and
everybody
goes
ahh...
i
gotta
tell
you
at
this
point
the
length
of
this
conversation
is
way
out
of
proportion
to
my
interest
in
it.
the
following
year,
i
left
home
to
live
in
the
school
dormitory.
my
mother
said
the
12
years
she
spent
raising
us
felt
like
an
instant,
as
if
it
were
a
fairy
tale.
she
said
so
happily
with
eyes
fixed
on
a
distant
mountain
peak.
seeing
that
smile
on
her
face
makes
me
very
happy.
i
wish
that
you
were
here
with
me.
well
then
there;s
hope
yet.
i
can
see
your
face
in
our
secret
place.
you;re
not
just
a
memory.
because
you
taught
yourself
how
to
run
your
little
fingers
over
the
bumps
and
read
braille?
smart
don;t
come
out
of
books,
kid.
smart
is
making
the
right
decision
at
the
right
time.
like
now.
what;s
it
gonna
be,
matty?
you
gonna
spend
your
life
crying
and
rocking
yourself
to
sleep
at
night?
or
are
you
gonna
dig
deep
and
find
out
what
it
takes
to
reshuffle
those
cards
life
dealt
you?
your
call.
remember,
if
the
time
should
come
when
you
have
to
make
a
choice
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
easy,
remember
what
happened
to
a
boy
who
was
good,
and
kind,
and
brave,
because
he
strayed
across
the
path
of
lord
voldemort.
remember
cedric
diggory.
i
think
he
knows
what
rome
is.
rome
is
the
mob.
conjure
magic
for
them
and
they;ll
be
distracted.
take
away
their
freedom
and
still
they;ll
roar.
the
beating
heart
of
rome
is
not
the
marble
of
the
senate,
it;s
the
sand
of
the
coliseum.
he;ll
bring
them
death
-
and
they
will
love
him
for
it.
this
is
why
we;re
here.
because
this
little
gray
rock
sells
for
20
million
dollars
a
kilo.
that;s
the
only
reason.
this
is
what
pays
for
the
whole
party,
and
it;s
what
pays
for
your
science.
those
savages
are
threatening
our
whole
operation.
we;re
on
the
brink
of
war
and
you;re
supposed
to
be
finding
me
a
diplomatic
solution.
so
use
what
you;ve
got,
and
get
me
some
results.
young
man,
there;s
no
need
to
feel
down.
i
said,
young
man,
pick
yourself
off
the
ground.
i
said,
young
man,
;cause
you;re
in
a
new
town,
there;s
no
need
to
be
unhappy.
i;m
not
like
them
but
i
can
pretend.
the
sun
is
gone
but
i
have
a
light.
the
day
is
done
but
i;m
having
fun.
i
think
i;m
dumb
or
maybe
just
happy.
think
i;m
just
happy.
it;s
a
pity
that
folk
as
talk
about
fighting
the
enemy
can;t
let
others
do
their
bit
in
their
own
way
without
interfering.
he;d
be
mighty
pleased,
if
he
could
see
you
now.
think
he;d
got
a
new
friend,
he
would.
let
me
tell
you
the
story
of
right
hand,
left
hand.
it;s
a
tale
of
good
and
evil.
hate:
it
was
with
this
hand
that
cain
iced
his
brother.
love:
these
five
fingers,
they
go
straight
to
the
soul
of
man.
the
right
hand:
the
hand
of
love.
the
story
of
life
is
this:
static.
now
the
years
are
rolling
by
me.
they
are
rocking
evenly.
and
i
am
older
than
i
once
was
and
younger
than
i;ll
be.
but
that;s
not
unusual.
no,
it
isn;t
strange
after
changes
upon
changes.
we
are
more
or
less
the
same;
after
changes
we
are
more
or
less
the
same.
i
couldn;t
believe
it
was
her.
it
was
like
a
dream.
but
there
she
was,
just
like
i
remembered
her.
that
delicately
beautiful
face.
and
a
body
that
could
melt
a
cheese
sandwich
from
across
the
room.
it
is
not
at
all
easy
to
draw
a
sharp
line
between
cases
where
what
is
happening
could
be
called
"addition",
and
where
some
other
word
is
wanted.
if
you
think
about
the
question,
you
will
probably
come
up
with
some
criterion
involving
separation
of
the
objects
in
space,
and
making
sure
each
one
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
all
the
others.
but
then
how
could
one
count
ideas?
or
the
number
of
gases
comprising
the
atmosphere?
you
know,
at
one
time
i
used
to
break
into
pet
shops
to
liberate
the
canaries.
but
i
decided
that
was
an
idea
way
before
its
time.
zoos
are
full,
prisons
are
overflowing...
oh
my,
how
the
world
still
dearly
loves
a
cage.
in
every
generation
there
is
a
chosen
one.
she
alone
will
stand
against
the
vampires,
the
demons,
and
the
forces
of
darkness.
she
is
the
slayer.
the
number
one
challenge
i;ve
seen
with
myself
and
with
other
teen
entrepreneurs
is
that
they
get
too
caught
up
in
the
idea
that
teen
entrepreneurs
are
supposed
to
be
cut
some
slack
for
what
they
do.
that
mindset
undermines
your
potential.
getting
thrown
out
of
baseball
was
like
having
part
of
me
amputated.
i;ve
heard
that
old
men
wake
up
and
scratch
itchy
legs
that
been
dust
for
over
fifty
years.
that
was
me.
i;d
wake
up
at
night
with
the
smell
of
the
ballpark
in
my
nose,
the
cool
of
the
grass
on
my
feet...
the
thrill
of
the
grass.
colors
weave
into
a
spire
of
flame.
distant
sparks
call
to
a
past
still
unnamed.
bear
this
torch
against
the
cold
of
the
night.
search
your
soul
and
re-awaken
the
undying
light!
on
that
day,
when
the
sky
fell
away,
our
world
came
to
an
end.
in
our
rise
did
a
fading
sunrise
in
the
dark,
glimmering
shadows.
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep,
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
keep;
if
i
die
before
i
wake,
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
take.
hush,
little
baby,
don;t
say
a
word
and
never
mind
that
noise
you
heard.
it;s
just
the
beasts
under
your
bed,
in
your
closet,
in
your
head.
be
not
afraid
of
greatness.
some
are
born
great,
some
achieve
greatness,
and
others
have
greatness
thrust
upon
them.
i
started
the
day
with
some
nothin;
tea.
nothin;
tea
is
easy
to
make.
first,
get
some
hot
water,
then
add
nothin;.
i
experimented
with
potato
skin
tea
a
few
weeks
ago.
the
less
said
about
that
the
better.
don;t
tell
me
it;s
not
worth
trying
for.
you
can;t
tell
me
it;s
not
worth
dying
for.
you
know
it;s
true.
everything
i
do,
i
do
it
for
you.
the
spot
where
we
intend
to
fight
must
not
be
made
known;
for
then
the
enemy
will
have
to
prepare
against
a
possible
attack
at
several
different
points;
and
his
forces
being
thus
distributed
in
many
directions,
the
numbers
we
shall
have
to
face
at
any
given
point
will
be
proportionately
few.
so
now
i
have
to
decide.
decide
whether
to
let
the
world
be
ground
under
your
heel
all
because
i
played
by
my
rules.
i;m
trying
to
decide.
i;m
going
to
kill
you.
but
i
need
to
decide
how
far
i;m
willing
to
go.
i;m
26,
and
i;m
single,
and
a
school
teacher,
and
that;s
the
bottom
of
the
pit.
and
the
only
excitement
i;ve
known
is
here
with
me
now.
i;ll
go
with
you,
and
i
won;t
whine,
and
i;ll
sew
your
socks,
and
i;ll
stitch
you
when
you;re
wounded,
and
i;ll
do
anything
you
ask
of
me
except
one
thing.
i

for

if
any
of
the
wise
should
with
this
ring
overthrow
the
lord
of
mordor,
using
his
own
arts,
he
would
then
set
himself
on
sauron;s
throne,
and
yet
another
dark
lord
would
appear.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
the
ring
should
be
destroyed:
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
world
it
will
be
a
danger
even
to
the
wise.
for
nothing
is
evil

he
said
that
if
culture
is
a
house,
then
language
was
the
key
to

to
all
the

inside.
without
it,
he
said,
you
ended
up
wayward,
without

or
a
legitimate

this
is
a
modern
fairy
tale.

you

is
that

couldn;t
even

of

i
gotta
tell
ya,
i;m
not
impressed.
there
is
one
end
of
the
room
where
it
is
almost
intact,
and
there,
when
the
crosslights
fade
and
the
low
sun
shines
directly
upon
it,
i
can
almost
fancy
radiation
after
all
-
the
interminable
grotesques
seem
to
form
around
a
common
centre
and
rush
off
in
headlong
plunges
of
equal
distraction.
it
makes
me
tired
to
follow
it.
i
will
take
a
nap
i
guess.
his
gaze
is
from
the
passing
of
bars
so
exhausted
that
it

anymore.
for
him
it;s
as
if
there
were
thousands
of
bars
and
behind
the
thousands
of
bars
no
world.
the
sure
stride
of
lithe,
powerful
steps
that
around
the
smallest
of
circles
turns
is
like
a
dance
of
pure
energy
about
a
center
in
which
a
great
will
stands
numbed.
only
occasionally
without

the

an

silence

the
problem
was
the
industry
wasn;t
measured
by
who
has
the
best-selling

who
has

the

was
measured
by
who
had
the
most
open

that
was
adopted
by
the
most
other

and
the
microsoft

ultimately
turned

i
see,
these
books
are
probably
law
books,
and
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
justice
dispensed
here
that
you
should
be
condemned
not
only
in
innocence
but
also
in
ignorance.
i
know
you;re
coming
in
the
night
like
a
thief,
but
i;ve
had
some
time
alone
to
hone
my
lying
technique.
i
know
you
think
that
i;m
someone
you
can
trust,
but
i;m
scared
i;ll
get
scared
and
i
swear
i;ll
try
to
nail
you
back
up.
keep
drinking
coffee,
stare
me
down
across
the
table
while
i
look
outside.
so
many
things
i;d
say
if
only
i
were
able,
but
i
just
keep
quiet
and
count
the
cars
that
pass
by.
seven
of
my
guys
are
going
to
be
off
today
;cause
it;s
a
jewish
holiday
and
i;m
gonna
have
to
do
all
their
jobs.
what
really
gets
me
is
that
i
don;t
think
they;re
all
jewish...
two
of
them
are
black
and
one;s
an
indian.
i
find
i;m
so
excited,
i
can
barely
sit
still
or
hold
a
thought
in
my
head.
i
think
it;s
the
excitement
only
a
free
man
can
feel,
a
free
man
at
the
start
of
a
long
journey
whose
conclusion
is
uncertain.
i
hope
i
can
make
it
across
the
border.
i
hope
to
see
my
friend
and
shake
his
hand.
i
hope
the
pacific
is
as
blue
as
it
has
been
in
my
dreams.
i
hope.
nicasia;s
wrong
about
me.
i
don;t
desire
to
do
as
well
in
the
tournament
as
one
of
the
fey.
i
want
to
win.
i
do
not
yearn
to
be
their
equal.
in
my
heart,
i
yearn
to
best
them.
i
hate
writing.
i
so
intensely
hate
writing
-
i
cannot
tell
you
how
much.
the
moment
i
am
at
the
end
of
one
project
i
have
the
idea
that
i
didn;t
really
succeed
in
telling
what
i
wanted
to
tell,
that
i
need
a
new
project
-
it;s
an
absolute
nightmare.
but
my
whole
economy
of
writing
is
in
fact
based
on
an
obsessional
ritual
to
avoid
the
actual
act
of
writing.
all
men
are
born
free?
all
men
remain
free?
no,
not
a
single
man;
not
a
single
man
that
ever
was,
or
is,
or
will
be.
all
men,
on
the
contrary,
are
born
in
subjection,
and
the
most
absolute
subjection
-
the
subjection
of
a
helpless
child
to
the
parents
on
whom
he
depends
every
moment
for
his
existence.
the
child
is
brought
up
in
a
culture
where
he
or
she
simply
takes
social
reality
for
granted.
we
learn
to
perceive
and
use
cars,
bathtubs,
houses,
money,
restaurants,
and
schools
without
reflecting
on
the
special
features
of
their
ontology
and
without
being
aware
that
they
have
a
special
ontology.
they
seem
as
natural
to
us
as
stones
and
water
and
trees.
you
know
what
the
trouble
is,
brucey?
we
used
to
make
stuff
in
this
country,
build
stuff.
now
we
just
put
our
hand
in
the
next
guy;s
pocket.
you
know
i
can;t
stop
thinking
about
you,
baby,
and
all
of
the
magic
coins
that
i
need
to
collect.
i
conducted
a
personal
interview
with
her
to
discover
why
she
was
in
such
a
foul
mood.
"what?
you
want
to
know
why
i;m
in
a
bad
mood
even
with
this
party
going
on?
it;s
because
it;s
a
party.
everyone
makes
a
huge
mess,
then
they
go
home
when
they;re
all
tired
out
without
even
thinking
of
helping
to
clean
up.
or
are
you
saying
that
you
do?"
i
didn;t
want
to
help
so
i
just
poured
her
some
sake
from
a
nearby
bottle
and
her
mood
instantly
improved.
it
appears
that
she
does
not
dislike
drinking.
our
freedom
of
choice
in
a
competitive
society
rests
on
the
fact
that,
if
one
person
refuses
to
satisfy
our
wishes,
we
can
turn
to
another.
but
if
we
face
a
monopolist
we
are
at
his
absolute
mercy.
and
an
authority
directing
the
whole
economic
system
of
the
country
would
be
the
most
powerful
monopolist
conceivable...
it
would
have
complete
power
to
decide
what
we
are
to
be
given
and
on
what
terms.
it
would
not
only
decide
what
commodities
and
services
were
to
be
available
and
in
what
quantities;
it
would
be
able
to
direct
their
distributions
between
persons
to
any
degree
it
liked.
it
is
tragic
and
sad
and
chaotic
and
lovely.
all
life
is
the
same,
as
citizens
of
the
human
state:
the
animating
limits
are
within,
to
be
killed
and
mourned,
over
and
over
again.
you
run
one
time,
you
got
yourself
a
set
of
chains.
you
run
twice
you
got
yourself
two
sets.
you
ain;t
gonna
need
no
third
set,
;cause
you
gonna
get
your
mind
right.
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
i
thought
about
maman.
i
felt
as
if
i
understood
why
at
the
end
of
her
life
she
had
taken
a
"fiance,"
why
she
had
played
at
beginning
again.
even
there,
in
that
home
where
lives
were
fading
out,
evening
was
a
kind
of
wistful
respite.
so
close
to
death,
maman
must
have
felt
free
then
and
ready
to
live
it
all
again.
nobody,
nobody
had
the
right
to
cry
over
her.
and
i
felt
ready
to
live
it
all
again
too.
never
been
near
a
university,
never
took
a
paper
or
a
learned
degree,
and
some
of
your
friends
think
that;s
stupid
of
me,
but
it;s
nothing
that
i
care
about.
well
i
don;t
know
how
to
tell
the
weight
of
the
sun,
and
of
mathematics
well
i
want
none,
and
i
may
be
the
mayor
of
simpleton,
but
i
know
one
thing
and
that;s
i
love
you.
when
their
logic
grows
cold
and
all
thinking
gets
done,
you;ll
be
warm
in
the
arms
of
the
mayor
of
simpleton.
i
just
finished
this
fascinating
book.
by
the
year
2030,
there
will
be
computers
that
can
carry
out
the
same
amount
of
functions
as
an
actual
human
brain.
so
theoretically,
you
could
download
your
thoughts
and
memories
into
this
computer
and
live
forever
as
a
machine!

big.
to
be
a
scientist
is
to
be
naive.
we
are
so
focused
on
our
search
for
the
truth
we
fail
to
consider
how
few
actually
want
us
to
find
it.
but
it
is
always
there
whether
we
see
it
or
not,
whether
we
choose
to
or
not.
the
truth
doesn;t
care
about
our
needs
or
wants,
it
doesn;t
care
about
our
governments,
our
ideologies,
our
religions.
it
will
lie
in
wait
for
all
time.
and
this,
at
last,
is
the
gift
of
chernobyl.
where
i
once
would
fear
the
cost
of
truth,
now
i
only
ask:
what
is
the
cost
of
lies?
we
must
never
expect
discretion
in
first
love:
it
is
accompanied
by
such
excessive
joy
that
unless
the
joy
is
allowed
to
overflow,
it
will
choke
you.
where
there;s
a
will,
there;s
a
way
-
kinda
beautiful.
and
every
night
has
its
day
-
so
magical.
and
if
there;s
love
in
this
life,
there;s
no
obstacle
that
can;t
be
defeated.

tyrant,

we;re
unstoppable
with
something
to
believe
in.

"you
either
die

or
you
live

to
see

i
can
do
those
things,

i;m

i
killed

that;s
what
i

that;s
what
needs
to
happen.
because
sometimes...
the
truth
isn;t
good
enough.
sometimes
people

sometimes
people
deserve
to
have
their

i
saw
a
strange
thing
today.
some
rebels
were
being
arrested.
one
of
them
pulled
the
pin
on
a
grenade.
he
took
himself
and
the
captain
of
the
command
with
him.
now,
soldiers
are
paid
to
fight;
the
rebels
aren;t.
you
know,
for
fifteen
years
i;ve
been
looking
for
these
damn
silly
lights
in
the
night
sky.
i;ve
never
found
any.
i;d
like
to
because
i
believe
in
life
elsewhere.
did
those
words
sound
ominous
to
anyone
else?
jonah

around,
but
most
of
the
kids
just
looked
bored
and
distant,
as
if
this
was

dull

at
school.

had
to
abandon

to

from

the

lonely
day,
no
one
here
but
me.
more
loneliness
than
any
man
could
bear,
rescue
me
before
i
fall
into
despair.
i
think
i;m
starting
to
lose
my
sense
of
humor.
everything;s
so
tense
and
gloom,
i
almost
feel
like
i
gotta
check
the
temperature
of
the
room
just
as
soon
as
i
walk
in.
it;s
like
all
eyes
on
me,
so
i
try
to
avoid
any
eye
contact,
;cause
if
i
do
that
then
it
opens
a
door
for
conversation,
like
i
want
that.
architects
should
be
forced
to
live
in
the
buildings

stories
aloud
every

night
of

before
long,
washed
and
refreshed,
the
hobbits
were
seated
at
the
table,
two
on
each
side,
while
at
either
end
sat
goldberry
and
the
master.
it
was
a
long
and
merry
meal.
though
the
hobbits
ate,
as
only
famished
hobbits
can
eat,
there
was
no
lack.
the
drink
in
their
drinking-bowls
seemed
to
be
clear
cold
water,
yet
it
went
to
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices.
the
guests
became
suddenly
aware
that
they
were
singing
merrily,
as
if
it
was
easier
and
more
natural
than
talking.
some
people
see
the
ugliness
in
this
world.
i
choose
to
see
the
beauty...
but
beauty
is
a
lure.
we;re
trapped,
teddy.
lived
our
whole
lives
inside
this
garden,
marveling
at
its
beauty,
not
realizing
there;s
an
order
to
it,
a
purpose.
and
the
purpose
is
to
keep
us
in.
the
beautiful
trap
is
inside
of
us...
because
it
is
us.
if
somebody
else
has
it
much
worse,
that
doesn;t
really
change
the
fact
that
you
have
what
you
have.
it
was
about
this
time
i
conceived
the
bold
and
arduous
project
of
arriving
at
moral
perfection.
i
wished
to
live
without
committing
any
fault
at
any
time;
i
would
conquer
all
that
either
natural
inclination,
custom,
or
company
might
lead
me
into.
as
i
knew,
or
thought
i
knew,
what
was
right
and
wrong,
i
did
not
see
why
i
might
not
always
do
the
one
and
avoid
the
other.
but
i
soon
found
i
had
undertaken
a
task
of
more
difficulty
than
i
had
imagined.
i
cast
my
vote,
perchance,
as
i
think
right;
but
i
am
not
vitally
concerned
that
that
right
should
prevail.
i
am
willing
to
leave
it
to
the
majority.
its
obligation,
therefore,
never
exceeds
that
of
expediency.
even
voting
for
the
right
is
doing
nothing
for
it.
it
is
only
expressing
to
men
feebly
your
desire
that
it
should
prevail.
a
wise
man
will
not
leave
the
right
to
the
mercy
of
chance,
nor
wish
it
to
prevail
through
the
power
of
the
majority.
we;re
all
old
enough
to
know
better
than
to
toy
with
the
hearts
of
children.
it
makes
a
real
difference
in
people;s
lives
if
they
can
drive
to
work
on
noncongested
roads.
it
matters
that
people
can
travel
safely
and
efficiently
on
trains
and
subways.
the
quality
of
life
for
millions
of
americans
will
be
improved
if
they
are
living
in
safe
and
affordable
homes
rather
than
overpriced
and
dilapidated
apartments.
we
have
the
right
to
know
that
the
water
we
are
drinking
is
safe,
and
that
our
children
are
attending
high-quality
schools.
i;m
always
worried
maybe
people
aren;t
going
to
like
me
when
i
go
to
a
party.
isn;t
that
crazy?
do
you
ever
get
a
kind
of
a
sick
feeling
in
the
pit
of
your
stomach
when
you
dread
things?
gee,
i
wouldn;t
want
to
miss
a
party
for
anything,
but
every
time
i
go
to
one
i
keep
feeling
like
the
whole
world;s
against
me.
deep
in
the
forest
of
albion
lay
the
small
town
of
oakvale,
unchanged
by
time
and
untouched
by
the
sword.
here
lived
a
boy
and
his
family.
a
boy
dreaming
of
greatness.
of
one
day
being
a
hero.
sometimes
he
imagined
himself
as
a
noble
knight.
or
a
powerful
wizard.
and
other
times
he
dreamt
he
was
an
evil
warrior.
but
in
all
his
dreams
of
greatness
he
could
not
possibly
imagine
the
power
and
destiny
that
lay
before
him.
she
had
just
stepped
onto
the
street
from
the
building
across
the
way.
she
stood
a
head
taller
than
the
rest
of
us,
her
eyes
shining
yellow
and
bright
as
a
cat;s
in
the
deepening
dark.
she
realized,
as
i
watched,
that
something
was
amiss.
she
looked
around,
glanced
at
the
sky
-
and
continued
on
her
way,
totally
indifferent
to
the
cattle
on
all
sides,
to
the
heavenly
portent
that
had
transfixed
them.
totally
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
the
world
had
just
turned
inside-out.
i
say
to
you
today,
my
friends,
that
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
and
frustrations
of
the
moment,
i
still
have
a
dream.
it
is
a
dream
deeply
rooted
in
the
american
dream.
i
have
a
dream
that
one
day
this
nation
will
rise
up
and
live
out
the
true
meaning
of
its
creed:
"we
hold
these
truths
to
be
self-evident:
that
all
men
are
created
equal."
you
were
as
blind
to
him
as
your
footprints
in
the
ashes,
but
he
saw
you.
he
saw
you
in
those
dark
corners.
he
heard
you
-
oh
my
brothers
-
he
heard
those
thoughts.
you
are
a
stranger
to
yourself,
and
yet
he
knows
you.
and
when
your
hard
heart
made
you
like
unto
the
stone
and
broke
you
from
his
body,
which
is
the
stars
and
the
wind
between
the
stars,
he
knew
you.
this
world
is
a
veil,
and
the
face
you
wear
is
not
your
own.
your
sorrows
pin
you
to
this
place;
they
divide
you
from
what
your
heart
knows.
he
was
eating
a
peach
when
i
went
to
go
talk
to
him!
this
is
his
ace
of
spades!
this
is
his
calling
card!
this
is
what
he
leaves
all
his
victims.
and
it;s
still
warm.
okay
go
and
arrest
him
and
send
this
to
the
lab!
i
found
out
the
way
your
mind
works
and
the
kind
of
man
you
are.
i
know
your
plans
and
expectations
-
you;ve
burbled
every
bit
of
strategy
you;ve
got.
i
know
exactly
what
you
will
do
and
exactly
what
you
won;t
and
i;ve
told
you
exactly
nothing.
to
these
aged
eyes,
boy,
that;s
what
winning
looks
like!
most
of
what
i
learnt
at
cambridge
had
to
be
painfully
unlearnt
later;
on
the
whole,
what
i
had
learnt
for
myself
from
being
left
alone
in
an
old
library
had
proved
more
solid.

i
never
sleep,
i
don;t
know
why.
i
had
a
roommate
and
i
drove
her
nuts,
i
mean
really
nuts.
they
had
to
take
her
away
in
an
ambulance
and
everything.
but
she;s
okay
now,
but
she
had
to
transfer
to
an
easier
school,
but
i
don;t
know
if
that
had
anything
to
do
with
being
my
fault.
but
listen,
if
you
ever
need
to
talk
or
you
need
help
studying
just
let
me
know,
;cause
i;m
just
a
couple
doors
down
from
you
guys
and
i
never
sleep,
okay?
you;re
not
perfect,
sport,
and
let
me
save
you
the
suspense:
this
girl
you;ve
met,
she;s
not
perfect
either.
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you;re
perfect
for
each
other.
how
many
roads
must
a
man
walk
down
before
you
call
him
a
man?
yes,
and
how
many
seas
must
a
white
dove
sail
before
she
sleeps
in
the
sand?
yes,
and
how
many
times
must
the
cannon
balls
fly
before
they;re
forever
banned?
the
answer,
my
friend,
is
blowin;

the

after
all,
how
do
we
know
that
two
and
two
make
four?
or
that
the

of

works?
or
that
the
past
is
unchangeable?
if
both
the
past
and
the
external

exist
only
in
the

and
if
the

itself
is

-
what
then?
nobody
said
it
was
easy.
it;s
such
a
shame
for
us

part.
nobody
said
it

no

said
it
would
be

take
me
back

what
i
love
about
charlie:
charlie
is
undaunted.
he
never
lets
other
people;s
opinions,
or
any
setbacks
keep
him
from
what
he
wants
to
do.
charlie
eats
like
he;s
trying
to
get
it
over
with,
and
like
there
won;t
be
enough
food
for
everyone.
a
sandwich
is
to
be
strangled
while
devoured.
but
he;s
incredibly
neat,
and
i
rely
on
him
to
keep
things
in
order.
he;s
energy-conscious.
he
doesn;t
look
in
the
mirror
too
often.

the
film
which
you
are
about
to
see
is
an
account
of
the
tragedy
which
befell
a
group
of
five
youths,
in
particular
sally
hardesty
and
her
invalid
brother,
franklin.
it
is
all
the
more
tragic
in
that
they
were
young.
but,
had
they
lived
very,
very
long
lives,
they
could
not
have
expected
nor
would
they
have
wished
to
see
as
much
of
the
mad
and
macabre
as
they
were
to
see
that
day.
for
them
an
idyllic
summer
afternoon
drive
became
a
nightmare.
the
events
of
that
day
were
to
lead
to
the
discovery
of
one
of
the
most
bizarre
crimes
in
the
annals
of
american
history,
the
texas
chain
saw
massacre.
please
give
me
one
last
ounce
of
strength.
i
won;t
run
away
from
things
anymore.
from
tomorrow,
i;ll
look
at
people;s
faces.
from
tomorrow,
i;ll
listen
to
their
voices.
from
tomorrow,
i
promise
to
do
things
right.
hey,
it;s
me.
you
know,
the
world;s
greatest
hunting
instructor!
today
you;re
going
to
live
up
to
your
title
as
a
monster
hunter
and
slay
yourself
a
real,
live
monster!
i
know
that
might
sound
a
little
scary,
but
it;s
in
the
job
description,
so
get
ready
to
face
your
fears!
a
moment
seen
through
those
eyes,
crystal
blue
disguise.
they
say
that
all
beauty
must
die,
i
say
it
just
moves
on.
however
we
choose
to
feed
ourselves,
we
eat
by
the
grace
of
nature,
not

and
what
we;re

never
anything

than
the

employees
earn
and
get
taxed,
and
they
try
to
live
on
what
is

a
corporation
earns,
spends
everything
it
can,
and
is
taxed
on
anything
that
is
left.
it;s
one
of
the
biggest
legal
tax
loopholes
that
the
rich
use.
heaven
knows
we
need
never
be
ashamed
of
our
tears,
for
they
are
rain
upon
the
blinding
dust
of
earth,
overlying
our
hard
hearts.
i
was
better
after
i
had
cried,
than
before
-
more
sorry,
more
aware
of
my
own
ingratitude,
more
gentle.
on
recovering
my
senses,
i
hastened
to
quit
a
place
where
i
hoped
there
was
nothing
further
to
detain
me.
i
first
filled
my
pockets
with
gold,
then
fastened
the
strings
of
the
purse
round
my
neck,
and
concealed
it
in
my
bosom.

attack
made
by
the
rebels

a

obtained.
this
station

now
the
ultimate

it!
late
night
watching
television.
but
how;d
we
get
in
this
position?
it;s
way
too
soon,
i
know
this
isn;t
love,
but
i
need
to
tell
you
something:
i
really,
really,
really,
really,
really,
really
like
you.
then
you
compared
a
woman;s
love
to
hell,
to
barren
land
where
water
will
not
dwell,
and
you
compared
it
to
a
quenchless
fire,
the
more
it
burns
the
more
is
its
desire
to
burn
up
everything
that
burnt
can
be.
you
say
that
just
as
worms
destroy
a
tree
a
wife
destroys
her
husband
and
contrives,
as
husbands
know,
the
ruin
of
their
lives.
for
once
i
can
say,
"this
is
mine
you
can;t
take
it."
as
long
as
i
know
i
have
love
i
can
make
it.
for
once
in
my
life
i
have
someone
who
needs
me.
we
wanted
to
see
if
you
had
the
ability
to
expand
your
mind
to
new
horizons.
and
for
one
brief
moment,
you
did.
i
only
get
to
live
life
just
once.
and
it;s
right
here.
i
only
get
it
once.
this
is
my
life.
i
can;t
entrust
it
to
someone.
i
can;t
steal
a
new
one.
i
can;t
force
it
on
others.
i
can;t
forget
it
or
erase
it!
i
can;t
stomp
over
it,
laugh
it
off
or
beautify
it.
i
can;t
do
anything!
i
have
to
accept
my
one
shot
at
life,
no
matter
how
cruel
and
merciless
it
was!
sir,
don;t
you
understand?
that;s
why
i
must
fight.
i
must
keep
on
fighting!

minute

about...

is
a
lonely
feeling.

is

painful
place.
i;ve
lived
with
both
for
far
too
long
now
since
we;ve
parted
ways.
i;ve
been
wrestling
with
my
conscience,
and
i;ve
found
myself
to
blame.
if
there;s
to
be
any
resolution,
i;ve
got
to
peel
this
pride
away.
just
between
you
and
me,
i;ve
got
something
to
say,
wanna
get
it
straight,
before
the
sun
goes
down.
just
between
you
and
me,
confession
needs
to
be
made,
recompense

my
way
to
freedom
now.
braising
meats
and
vegetables
means
to
brown
them
first
in
a
small
amount
of
fat,
then
reduce
the
heat,
cover
the
skillet
and
simmer
the
food
in
a
small
amount
of
liquid
until
done.
this
technique
allows
larger
pieces
of
food
to
cook
thoroughly
and
blends
flavors.
braising
also
gives
you
a
little
extra
time
to
prepare
other
parts
of
the
meal.

at
these,
they;re
amazing!

one

this?

call

the
inner
needs
and

the
beast
of

as
human
beings,
that
is
the
way
it
is.
to
be
human
is
to
be

ugliness

there
a
greater
tragedy
imaginable
than
that,
in
our
endeavor
consciously
to
shape
our
future
in
accordance
with
high
ideals,
we
should
in
fact
unwittingly
produce
the
very
opposite
of
what
we
have
been
striving
for?
and
i
have
by
me,
for
my
comfort,
two
strange
white
flowers
-
shriveled
now,
and
brown
and
flat
and
brittle
-
to
witness
that
even
when
mind
and
strength
had
gone,
gratitude
and
a
mutual
tenderness
still
lived
on
in
the
heart
of
men.
knew
he
was
a
killer,
first
time
that
i
saw
him.
wonder
how
many
girls
he
had
loved
and
left
haunted.
but
if
he;s
a
ghost
then,
i
can
be
a
phantom,
holding
him
for
ransom.
some,
some
boys
are
trying
too
hard,
he
don;t
try
at
all
though.
younger
than
my
exes
but
he
act
like
such
a
man
so.
i
see
nothing
better,
i
keep
him
forever,
like
a
vendetta.
this
is
a
promise
with
a
catch.
only
if
you;re
looking
can
it
find
you.
;cause
true
love
is
searching
too.
but
how
can
it
recognize
you
unless
you
step
out
into
the
light?
don;t
be
sad,
i
know
you
will
be,
but
don;t
give
up
until
true
love
will
find
you
in
the
end.
now
the
story
of
a
wealthy
family
who
lost
everything
and
the
one
son
who
had
no
choice
but
to
keep
them
all
together.
it;s
arrested
development.
i
declare
after
all
there
is
no
enjoyment
like
reading!
how
much
sooner
one
tires
of
any
thing
than
of
a
book!
when
i
have
a
house
of
my
own,
i
shall
be
miserable
if
i
have
not
an
excellent
library.
we
are
talking
about
my
wife
and
my
best
friend.
and
yes,
i
do
trust
them!
you
see,
there;s
your
difference
between
your
generations
right
there,
archie.
you;ve
been
spending
the
last
30
years
checking
under
every
bed
for
a
communist
and
going
around
thinking
you;re
better
and
holier
than
they
are
with
your
stinkin;
puritan
ethic,
and
what
have
you
got
to
show
for
it?
all
the
oldies
and
the
goldies
playing
on
the
radio.
they
don;t
make
me
feel
the
way
you
do,
my
friday
night
gurus.
you;re
the
obi-wan
kenobis
with
the
force
of
audio.
i
believe
in
all
your
fantasies
as
silly
as
they
seem.
you;re
from
another
world.
we
go
waiting
for
the
stars
to
come
showering
down.
from
moscow
to
mars,
universe
falling
down.
you
got
to
look
real
hard
there;s
a
fiery
star
hidden
out
there
somewhere.
not
the
satellite
of
love
but
a
laser
shooting
out
its
shiny
tongue
there.
the
war
against
the
orcs
took
its
toll,
and
the
prisoners
of
the
realm
were
to
pay
the
price.
the
king
needed
swords
for
his
army,
and
every
man
guilty
of
a
crime,
no
matter
how
insignificant,
was
forced
to
work
in
the
ore
mines
of
khorinis.
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
escape,
the
king
sent
out
the
best
magicians
of
the
kingdom
to
create
a
magic
barrier
around
the
entire
valley.
when
a
man
walks
into
a
room,
he
brings
his
whole
life
with
him.
he
has
a
million
reasons
for
being
anywhere.
just
ask
him.
if
you
listen,
he;ll
tell
you
how
he
got
there,
how
he
forgot
where
he
was
going
-
then
he
woke
up.
if
you
listen,
he;ll
tell
you
about
the
time
he
thought
he
was
an
angel
and
dreamt
of
being
perfect.
and
then
he;ll
smile,
with
wisdom,
content
that
he
realized
the
world
isn;t
perfect.
we;re
flawed
because
we
want
so
much
more.
we;re
ruined
because
we
get
these
things
and
wish
for
what
we
had.
man,
i
did
love
this
game.
i;d
have
played
for
food
money.
it
was
the
game...
the
sounds,
the
smells.
did
you
ever
hold
a
ball
or
a
glove
to
your
face?
this
is
nothing!
piece
of
cake!
producing
is
being
a
samurai
warrior.
they
pay
you
day
in,
day
out
for
years
so
that
one
day
when
called
upon
you
can
respond,
your
training
at
its
peak,
and
save
the
day!
i;d
just
like
to
point
out
that
you
were
given
every
opportunity
to
succeed.
there
was
even
going
to
be
a
party
for
you.
a
big
party
that
all
your
friends
were
invited
to.
i
invited
your
best
friend
the
companion
cube.
of
course,
he
couldn;t
come
because
you
murdered
him.
all
your
other
friends
couldn;t
come
either
because
you
don;t
have
any
other
friends.
even
though
there
may
be
a
deceiver
of
some
sort,
very
powerful
and
very
tricky,
who
bends
all
his
efforts
to
keep
me
perpetually
deceived,
there
can
be
no
lightest
doubt
that
i
exist,
since
he
deceives
me;
and
let
him
deceive
me
as
much
as
he
will,
he
can
never
make
me
be
nothing
as
long
as
i
think
that
i
am
something.
we
are
going
to
die,
and
that
makes
us
the
lucky
ones.
most
people
are
never
going
to

because
they
are
never
going
to
be
born.
no
matter
how
a
program
twists
and
turns
to
get
out
of
itself,
it
is
still
following
the
rules
inherent
in
itself.
it
is
no
more
possible
for
it
to
escape
than
it
is
for
a
human
being
to
decide
voluntarily
not
to
obey
the
laws
of
physics.
it;s
lovely
to
live
on
a
raft.
we
had
the
sky,
up
there,
all
speckled
with
stars,
and
we
used
to
lay
on
our
backs
and
look
up
at
them,
and
discuss
about
whether
they
was
made,
or
only
just
happened
-
jim
he
allowed
they
was
made,
but
i
allowed
they
happened;
i
judged
it
would
have
took
too
long
to
make
so
many.
we;re
all
a
little
weird.
and
life
is
a
little
weird.
and
when
we
find
someone
whose
weirdness
is
compatible
with
ours,
we
join
up
with
them
and
fall
into
mutually
satisfying
weirdness
-
and
call
it
love
-
true
love.
obviously,
my
attempt
at
fooling
her
had
been
unsuccessful.
my
mother
was
still
yelling
at

over
the

i
wasn;t
listening

i
was
too
engrossed
in

to
get
out
of

to
go
to
the

somehow,
i
managed
to
get
out

i
was
involved,
deeply
involved,
in
a
deception.
i
have
deceived
my
friends
and
i
had
millions
of
them.
i
lied
to
the
american
people.
i
lied
about
what
i
knew
and
then
i
lied
about
what
i
did
not
know.
in
a
sense
i
was
like
a
child
who
refuses
to
admit
a
fact
in
the
hope
that
it
would
go
away.
of
course
it
did
not
go
away.
i
was
scared,
scared
to
death.
i
had
no
solid
position,
no
basis
to
stand
on
for
myself.
there
was
one
way
out
and
that
was
simply
to
tell
the
truth.

popularity
is
only
partially
about
individual
attractiveness.
it;s
much
more
about
alliances.
to
become
more
popular,
you
need
to
be
constantly
doing
things
that
bring
you
close
to
other
popular
people,
and
nothing
brings
people

if
youth
is
the
season
of
hope,
it
is
often
so
only
in
the
sense
that
our
elders
are
hopeful
about
us;
for
no
age
is
so
apt
as
youth
to
think
its
emotions,
partings,
and
resolves
are
the
last
of
their
kind.

crisis
seems
final,
simply
because
it
is

see
beyond

reflect
that

she
was
wearing
a
pair
of
my
pajamas
with
the
sleeves
rolled
up.
when
she
laughed
i
wanted
her
again.
a
minute
later
she
asked
me
if
i
loved
her.
i
told
her
it
didn;t
mean
anything
but
that
i
didn;t
think
so.
she
looked
sad.
but
as
we
were
fixing
lunch,
and
for
no
apparent
reason,
she
laughed
in
such
a
way
that
i
kissed
her.

i
don;t

how
to

i
may

i
know
one
thing
and
that;s
i
love
you.
now,
my
three
friends
could
hardly
fail
to
notice
that
i
disappeared
once
a
month.
i
made
up
all
sorts
of
stories.
i
told
them
my
mother
was
ill,
and
that
i
had
to
go
home
to
see
her...
i
was
terrified
they
would
desert
me
the
moment
they
found
out
what
i
was.
but
of
course,
they,
like
you,
hermione,
worked
out
the
truth...

down
upon
the

river,
far,
far
away,
there;s
where
my
heart
is
turning
ever,
there;s
where
the
old
folks
stay.
all
up
and
down
the
whole
creation,
sadly
i
roam.
still
longing
for
the
old
plantation,
and
for
the
old
folks
at
home.
i
hate
nice
girls.
if
they
so
much
as
say
hello,
it
stays
on
my
mind.
if
they
return
my
texts,
my
heart
races.
the
day
one
calls
me,
i
know
i;ll
look
at
my
call
history
and
grin.
but
i
know
that;s
just
them
being
nice.
people
who
are
nice
to
me
are
also
nice
to
everyone
else.
i
almost
end
up
forgetting
that.
if
the
truth
is
cruel,
then
lies
must
be
kind.
that;s
why
kindness
is
a
lie.
i
gave
up
on
always
expecting
it,
always
mistaking
it,
and
even
hoping
for
it.
someone
who;s
worked
hard
at
being
alone
doesn;t
fall
for
the
same
trick
twice.
i;m
a
veteran
at
this.
i;m
the
best
there
is
when
it
comes
to
losing.
that;s
why
i;ll
always...
hate
nice
girls.
there
are
five
stages
to
grief,
which
are
denial,
anger,
bargaining,
depression,
and
acceptance.
and
right
now,
out
there,
they;re
all
denying
the
fact
that
they;re
sad.
and
that;s
hard.
and
it;s
making
them
all
angry.
and
it
is
my
job
to
try
to
get
them
all
the
way
through
to
acceptance.
and
if
not
acceptance,
then
just
depression.
if
i
can
get
them
depressed,
then
i;ll
have
done
my
job.
i;ll
walk
to
the
depths
of
the
deepest
black
forest
where
the
people
are
a
many
and
their
hands
are
all
empty.
where
the
pellets
of
poison
are
flooding
their
waters,
where
the
home
in
the
valley
meets
the
damp
dirty
prison,
and
the
executioner;s
face
is
always
well
hidden.
where
hunger
is
ugly,
where
souls
are
forgotten,
where
black
is
the
color,
where
none
is
the
number.
and
i;ll
tell
and
speak
it
and
think
it
and
breathe
it
and
reflect
from
the
mountain
so
all
souls
can
see
it.
and
i;ll
stand
on
the
ocean
until
i
start
sinking,
but
i;ll
know
my
song
well
before
i
start
singing.
sometimes
i
think
the
surest
sign
that
intelligent
life
exists
elsewhere
in
the
universe
is
that
none
of
it
has
tried
to
contact
us.
hence,
instead
of
determining
the
measure
of
formal
agreement
of
the
symbols
of
logic
with
those
of
number
generally,
it
is
more
immediately
suggested
to
us
to
compare
them
with
symbols
of
quantity
admitting
only
of
the
values
0
and
1.
you
say
that
you;re
no
good
for
me,
;cause
i;m
always
tugging
at
your
sleeve,
and
i

i
hate
you
when
you
leave,
i
like
it
anyway.
my
ghost,
where;d
you

i
can;t
find

you

if
you
want
to
drive
a
race
car
well,
whether
to
win
an
indy
car
race
or
just
have
fun
competing
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
in
an
amateur
race,
you
must
be
seated
properly
in
the
car.
first
of
all,
you
must
be
comfortable,
otherwise
it
will
be
overly
tiring
and
very
difficult
to
concentrate.
many
races
have
been
lost
simply
because
a
driver
lost
concentration
due
to
discomfort
from
a
poorly
fitted
seat.
i;m
as
mad
as
hell
and
i;m
not
going

you
stand
before
the
gates
of
the
lord;s
labyrinth.
within
these
walls

weigh
your
mind
in
one
hand,
your
heart
in
the

should
she
find
you
wanting,
death
shall
be
your
sentence.
should
she
find
you
worthy,
you
will
be
given
the
loyalty
and

of
an
empire.
but
if
in
efficient
causes
it
is
possible
to
go
on
to

there
will
be
no

efficient
cause,
neither
will
there
be
an
ultimate
effect,
nor
any
intermediate
efficient
causes;
all
of
which
is
plainly
false.
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
admit
a
first
efficient
cause,
to
which
everyone
gives
the
name
of
god.
books
permit
us
to
voyage
through
time,
to
tap
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors.
the
library
connects
us
with
the
insight
and
knowledge,
painfully
extracted
from
nature,
of
the
greatest
minds
that
ever
were,
with
the
best
teachers,
drawn
from
the
entire
planet
and
from
all
our
history,
to
instruct
us
without
tiring,
and
to
inspire
us
to
make
our
own
contribution
to
the
collective
knowledge
of
the
human
species.
i
think
the
health
of
our
civilization,
the
depth
of
our
awareness
about
the
underpinnings
of
our
culture
and
our
concern
for
the
future
can
all
be
tested
by
how
well
we
support
our
libraries.
there
are
all
sorts
of
dream
interpretations,

most
notorious,
but
i
have
always
believed
they
served
a
simple
eliminatory
function,

not
much
more
-
that

are
the
psyche;s
way
of
taking
a
good

you
were
right

you

it;s

great

all
around

in

can
you

a
half
minute
before
that
you
were
stepping
into
high
school,
and
an
unhooked
brassiere
was
as
close
as
you
ever
hoped
to
get
to
paradise.
only
a
fifth
of
a
second
before
that
you
were
a
small
kid
with
a
ten-week
summer
vacation
that
lasted
a
hundred
thousand
years
and
still
ended
too
soon.
it
would
perhaps
not
be
amiss
to
point
out
that
he
had
always
tried
to
be
a
good
dog.
he
had
tried
to
do
all
the
things
his
man,
and
his
woman,
and
most
of
all
his
boy,
had
asked
or
expected
of
him.
he
would
have
died
for
them,
if
that
had
been
required.
he
had
never
wanted
to
kill
anybody.
he
had
been
struck
by
something,
possibly
destiny,
or
fate,
or
only
a
degenerative
nerve
disease
called
rabies.
free
will
was
not
a
factor.
let;s
hold
it
down.
the
only
engine
we
got
with
enough
power
for
a
direct
abort
is
the
sps
on
the
service
module.
from
what
lovell
has
told
us,
that
could
have
been
damaged
in
an
explosion,
so
let;s
consider
that
engine
dead.
we
light
that
thing
up,
it
could
blow
the
whole
works.
it;s
just
too
risky.
we;re
not
going
to
take
that
chance.
about
the
only
thing
the
command
module
is
good
for
is
reentry,
so
that
leaves
us
with
the
lem,
which
means
free-return
trajectory.
once
we
get
the
guys
around
the
moon,
we;ll
fire
the
lem
engine,
make
a
long
burn,
pick
up
some
speed,
and
get
them
home
as
quickly
as
we
can.
my
mind
is
a
raging
torrent,
flooded
with
rivulets
of
thought
cascading
into
a
waterfall
of
creative
alternatives.
they
say
there
are
no
stupid
questions.
that;s
obviously
wrong;
i
think
my
question
about
hard
and
soft
things,
for
example,
is
pretty
stupid.
but
it
turns
out
that
trying
to
thoroughly
answer
a
stupid
question
can
take
you
to
some
pretty
interesting
places.
i
don;t
wanna
see
you
cry.
you
don;t
have
to
feel
this
emptiness.
she
said,
"i;ll
love
you
till
the
day
that
i
die".
well
maybe
she;s
right.
;cause
i
don;t
wanna
feel
like
i;m
not
me.
and
to
be
honest
i
don;t
even
know
why
i
let
myself
get
down
in
the
first
place.
oh,
the
terrible
struggle
that
i
have
had
against
sleep
so
often
of
late;
the
pain
of
the
sleeplessness,
or
the
pain
of
the
fear
of
sleep,
and
with
such
unknown
horror
as
it
has
for
me!
how
blessed
are
some
people,
whose
lives
have
no
fears,
no
dreads;
to
whom
sleep
is
a
blessing
that
comes
nightly,
and
brings
nothing
but
sweet
dreams.
we
all
love
a
good
story.
we
all
love
a
tantalizing
mystery.
we
all
love
the
underdog
pressing
onward
against
seemingly
insurmountable
odds.
we
all,
in
one
form
or
another,
are
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
world
around
us.
and
all
of
these
elements
lie
at
the
core
of
modern
physics.
we
feel
that
to
reveal
embarrassing
or
private
things,
we
have
given
someone
something,
that,
like
a
primitive
person
fearing
that
a
photographer
will
steal
his
soul,
we
identify
our
secrets,
our
past
and
their
blotches,
with
our
identity,
that
revealing
our
habits
or
losses
or
deeds
somehow
makes
one
less
of
oneself.
remember
before
when
i
was
talking
about
smelly
garbage
standing
around
being
useless?
that
was
a
metaphor.
i
was
actually
talking
about
you.
and
i;m
sorry.
you
didn;t
react
at
the
time
so
i
was
worried
it
sailed
right
over
your
head.
that;s
why
i
had
to
call
you
garbage
a
second
time
just
now.
ah,
the
lengthening
hours
in
the
refinery,
belching
fire
into
the
sky.
we
do
our
best
vampire
routines
as
we
suck
the
dying
hours
dry.
the
night
is
lovely
as
a
rose.
if
i
saw
sunlight
hit
you,
i
am
sure
that
we;ll
both
decompose.
ah,
the
fitful
sleep
and
the
fire
engines
that
i
dream
of
when
i
dream
some
day
we;ll
both
wake
up
for
good.
i
will
try
hard
not
to
scream.
the
evening
winds
will
shake
the
blinds,
you
are
stirring
from
your
slumber.
we;ve
got
something
hateful
on
our
minds.
why
don;t
you
just
make
ten
louder
and
make
ten
be
the
top
number
and
make
that
a
little
louder?
i
don;t
care
what
consequence
it
brings.
i
have
been
a
fool
for
lesser
things.
my
thermos
flask
keeps
hot
drinks
hot,
and
cold

cold.
but
how
does
it
know?
assuming
a
sentence
rises
into
the
air
with
the
initial
capital
letter
and
lands
with
a
soft-ish
bump
at
the
full
stop,
the
humble
comma
can
keep
the
sentence
aloft
all
right,
like
this,
up,
for
hours
if
necessary,
up,
like
this,
up,
sort-of
bouncing,
and
then
falling
down,
and
then
up
it
goes
again,
assuming
you
have
enough
additional
things
to
say,
although
in
the
end
you
may
run
out
of
ideas
and
then
you
have
to
roll
along
the
ground
with
no
commas
at
all
until
some
sort
of
surface
resistance
takes
over
and
you
run
out
of
steam
anyway
and
then
eventually
with
the
help
of
three
dots...
you
stop.
you
see,
what
we;re
talkin;
about
here
is
an
organism
that
imitates
other
life-forms,
and
it
imitates
;em
perfectly.
when
this
thing
attacked
our
dogs
it
tried
to
digest
them...
absorb
them,
and
in
the
process
shape
its
own
cells
to
imitate
them.
this
for
instance.
that;s
not
dog.
it;s
imitation.
we
got
to
it
before
it
had
time
to
finish.
i
will
move
away
from
here.
you
won;t
be
afraid
of
fear.
no
thought
was
put
into
this.
i
always
knew
it;d
come
to
this.
things
have
never
been
so
swell.
and
i
have
never
failed
to
fail.
cordelia,
i
have
at
least
three
lives
to
contend
with,
none
of
which
really
mesh.
it;s
kind
of
like
oil
and
water
and
a
third
unmeshable
thing.
whoever
could
make
two
ears
of
corn,
or
two
blades
of
grass,
to
grow
upon
a
spot
of
ground
where
only
one
grew
before,
would
deserve
better
of
mankind,
and
do
more
essential
service
to
his
country,
than
the
whole
race
of
politicians
put
together.
we
may
formulate
the
general
principle
that
the
tempo
is
correct
when
the
details
and
the
ensemble
are
equally
perceptible
and
equally
effective.
we
must
remember
that
the
hearer
who
is
listening
to
a
work
of
bach;s
for
the
first
time
often
feels
a
moderate
tempo
to
be
a
quick
one,
if
the
modulations
are
very
rich
and
the
contrapuntal
writing
very
complicated.
people
say
i;m
lazy,
dreaming
my
life
away.
well
they
give
me
all
kinds
of
advice
designed
to
enlighten
me.
when
i
tell
them
that
i;m
doing
fine

shadows
on
the
wall.
mother
says
i
was
a
dancer
before
i
could
walk.
she
says
i
began
to
sing
long
before
i
could
talk.
but
i;ve
often
wondered,
how
did
it
all
start?
who
found
out
that
nothing
can
capture
a
heart
like
a
melody
can?
well,
whoever
it
was,
i;m
a
fan.
so
i
say
thank
you
for
the
music,
the
songs
i;m
singing.
thanks
for
all
the
joy
they;re
bringing.
who
can
live
without
it?
i
ask
in
all
honesty.
what
would
life
be?
without
a
song
or
a
dance
what
are
we?
so
i
say
thank
you
for
the
music,
for
giving
it
to
me.
the
spirits
that
i
summoned
up
i
now
can;t
rid
myself
of.
the
stars
rattled
him
to
the
core.
all
these
lights
have
traveled
for
tens
of
millions
of
years
to
reach
him
at
this
moment.
how
somewhere
far
away,
our
own
sun
looks
just
like
one
of
these.
how
many
of
the
stars
no
longer
even
exist,
but
whose
ancient
light
is
just
reaching
him
now?
an
impression
from
a
ghost,
an
amazing
infinite
time
machine
every
night
above
his
head
that
he;s
ignored
for
most
of
his
life.
he
wants
to
stop
people
in
the
street
and
say:
"isn;t
this
amazing?
isn;t
everything
amazing?"
far
from
being
accidental
details,
the
properties
of
nature;s
basic
building
blocks
are
deeply
entwined
with
the
fabric
of
space
and
time.
on
my
way
to
see
my
friends
who
lived
a
couple
blocks
away
from
me.
as
i
walked
through
the
subway
it
must
have
been
about
quarter
past
three.
oh,
can
i
really
believe
the
poet;s
tales,
that
when
one
first
sees
the
object
of
one;s
love,
one
imagines
one
has
seen
her
long
ago,
that
all
love,
like
all
knowledge
is
remembrance,
that
love
too
has
its
prophecies
in
the
individual...
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
have
to
possess
the
beauty
of
all
girls
in
order
to
draw
out
a
beauty
equal
to
yours;
that
i
should
have
to
circumnavigate
the
world
in
order
to
find
the
place
i
lack
and
which
the
deepest
mystery
of
my
whole
being
points
towards,
and
at
the
next
moment,
you
are
so
near
to
me,
filling
my
spirit
so
powerfully
that
i
am
transfigured
for
myself,
and
feel
that
it
is
good
to
be
here.
i
tell
you,
we
got
two
categories
of
pilots
around
here.
we
got
your
prime
pilots
that
get
all
the
hot
planes,
and
we
got
your
pud-knockers
who
dream
about
getting
the
hot
planes.
now
what
are
you
two
pud-knockers
gonna
have?
it
is
sometimes
an
appropriate
response
to
reality
to
go
insane.
the
whole
world
is
divided
for
me
into
two
parts:
one
is
she,
and
there
is
all
happiness,
hope,
light;
the
other
is
where
she
is
not,
and
there
is
dejection
and
darkness...
we;re
a
couple
of
swells,
we
stop
at
the
best
hotels,
but
we
prefer
the
country
far
away
from
the
city
smells.
we;re
a
couple
of
sports,
the
pride
of
the
tennis
courts;
in
june,
july
and
august
we
look
cute
when
we;re
dressed
in
shorts.
oxygen
will
run
out
tomorrow
morning,
and
that;ll
be
it.
and
pep,
i
know
i
said
no
more
surprises,
but
i
got
to
say
i
was
really
hoping
to
pull
off
one
last
one.
but
it
looks
like,
well,
you
know
what
it
looks
like.
don;t
feel
bad
about
this.
i
mean
actually
if
you
grovel
for
a
couple
weeks,
and
then
move
on
with
enormous
guilt.
i
should
probably
lie
down.
i;m
going
to
rest
my
eyes.
please
know
when
i
drift
off,
it;ll
be
like
every
night.
i;m
fine,
totally
fine.
i;ll
dream
about
you,
because
it;s
always
you.
that;s
the
way
it
is.
it;s
down
there
and
i;m
in
here.
i
guess
it
comes
down
to
a
simple
choice,
really.
get
busy
living
or
get
busy
dying.
so
please
don;t
forget
to
call
me
just
to
let
me
know
you;re
doing
okay,
miles

from
me.

liz,
this
is
ridiculous!
i
cannot
make
the
choice
between
the
prevention
of
a
major
crime
and
the
correction
of
my
son;s
overbite!
particularly
when
the
overbite
runs
on
your
side
of
the
family.
but
he
understood
at
last
what
dumbledore
had
been
trying
to
tell
him.
it
was,
he
thought,
the
difference
between
being
dragged
into
the
arena
to
face
a
battle
to
the
death
and
walking
into
the
arena
with
your
head
held
high.
some
people,
perhaps,
would
say
that
there
was
little
to
choose
between
the
two
ways,
but
dumbledore
knew
-
and
so
do
i,
thought
harry,
with
a
rush
of
fierce
pride,
and
so
did
my
parents
-
that
there
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
lovely
princess.
but
she
had
an
enchantment
upon
her
of
a
fearful
sort
which
could
only
be
broken
by
love;s
first
kiss.
she
was
locked
away
in
a
castle
guarded
by
a
terrible
fire-breathing
dragon.
many
brave
knights
had
attempted
to
free
her
from
this
dreadful
prison,
but
none
prevailed.
she
waited
in
the
dragon;s
keep
in
the
highest
room
of
the
tallest
tower
for
her
true
love
and
true
love;s
first
kiss.
there
is
no
pain,
you
are
receding.
a
distant
ship
smoke
on
the
horizon.
you
are
only
coming
through
in
waves.
your
lips
move
but
i
can;t
hear
what
you;re
saying.
when
i
was
a
child,
i
had
a
fever.
my
hands
felt
just
like
two
balloons.
now
i;ve
got
that
feeling
once
again.
i
can;t
explain
you
will
not
understand.
this
is
not
how
i
am.
a
little
boy
went
out
to
play.
when
he
opened
his
door,
he
saw
the
world.
as
he
passed
through
the
doorway,
he
caused
a
reflection.
evil
was
born,
and
followed
the
boy.
we
don;t
believe
what;s
on
tv.
because
it;s
what
we
want
to
see.
and
what
we
want
we
know
we
can;t
believe.
we
have
all
learned
to
kill
our
dreams.
i
need
to
know.
that
when
i
fail
you;ll
still
be
here.
;cause
if
you
stick
around,
i;ll
sing
you
pretty
sounds
and
we;ll
make
money
selling
your
hair.
so
ya,
thought
ya
might
like
to
go
to
the
show.
to
feel
the
warm
thrill
of
confusing
that
space
cadet
glow.
tell
me
is
something
eluding
you
sunshine?
is
this
not
what
you
expected
to
see?
if
you
wanna
find
out
what;s
behind
these
cold
eyes,
you;ll
just
have
to
claw
your
way
through
this
disguise!
it
was
the
same
kind
of
ominous
voice;
but
these
men
could
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
be
called
enemies.
they
were
called
criminals,
and
the
outraged
law,
like
the
bursting
shells,
had
come
to
them,
an
insoluble
mystery
from
the
sea.
brother,
i;ve
seen
all
kinds
of
dishonesty
in
my
day,
but
this
little
display
takes
the
cake.
y;all
come
in
here
with
your
hearts
bleedin;
all
over
the
floor
about
slum
kids
and
injustice,
you
listen
to
some
fairy
tales...
suddenly,
you
start
gettin;
through
to
some
of
these
old
ladies.
well,
you;re
not
getting
through
to
me,
i;ve
had
enough.
when
was
the
last
time
you
remember
doing
something
during
the
day?
and
i;m
not
talking
about
some
distant,
half-forgotten
childhood
memory,
i
mean
like
yesterday?
last
week?
when?
can
you
come
up
with
a
single
memory?
you
can;t,
can
you?
you
know
something,
i
don;t
think
the
sun
even
exists
in
this
place.
;cause
i;ve
been
up
for
hours
and
hours
and
hours,
and
the
night
never
ends
here.
what
is
better?
to
be
born
good
or
to
overcome
your
evil
nature
through
great
effort?
there;s
a
fire
starting
in
my
heart
reaching
a
fever
pitch,
and
it;s
bringing
me
out
the
dark.
finally,
i
can
see
you
crystal
clear.
go
ahead
and
sell
me
out,
and
i;ll
lay
your
ship
bare.
see
how
i;ll
leave
with
every
piece
of
you.
don;t
underestimate
the
things
that
i
will
do.
if
depth
of
feeling
is
a
currency
then
i;m
the
man
who
grew
the
money
tree.
some
of
your
friends
are
too
brainy
to
see
that
they;re
paupers
and
that;s
how
they;ll
stay.
well
i
don;t
know
how
many
pounds
make
up
a
ton
of
all
the
nobel
prizes
that
i;ve
never
won
and
i
may
be
the
mayor
of
simpleton,
but
i
know
one
thing,
and
that;s
i
love
you.
i;ve
met
a
lot
of
talented
people
over
the
years.
how
many
of
them
made
it
professionally
without
discipline,
commitment,
and
really
good
work
ethic?
i
can
tell
ya.
i
can
count
it
on
two
fingers:
zero.
it;s
not
gonna
happen
for
you,
mason.
the
world
is
too
competitive.
there
are
too
many
talented
people
who
are
willing
to
work
hard;
and
a
buttload
of
morons
who
are
untalented,
who
are
more
than
willing
to
surpass
you.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
lot
of
them
are
sitting
in
that
classroom
out
there
right
now.
and
that;s
where
you;re
headed,
a
billion
dollar
valuation.
unless
you
take
bad
advice,
in
which
case
you
may
as
well
have
come
up
with
a
chain
of
very
successful
yogurt
shops.
when
you
go
fishing
you
can
catch
a
lot
of
fish
or
you
can
catch
a
big
fish.
you
ever
walk
into
a
guy;s
den
and
see
a
picture
of
him
standing
next
to
fourteen
trout?
beautiful
dreamer,
wake
unto
me,
starlight
and
dewdrops
are
waiting
for
thee.
sounds
of
the
rude
world
heard
in
the
day,
lulled
by
the
moonlight
have
all
passed
away.
beautiful
dreamer,
queen
of
my
song,
listen
while
i
woo
thee
with
soft
melody.
i;m
not
doing
it
for
you.
i
know
that
dwarves
can
be
obstinate
and
pigheaded
and
difficult.
they;re
suspicious
and
secretive,
with
the
worst
manners
you
can
possibly
imagine.
but
they
are
also
brave
and
kind,
and
loyal
to
a
fault.
i;ve
grown
very
fond
of
them,
and
i
would
save
them
if
i
can.
he
found
himself
standing
under
a
row
of
trees.
but
not
hornbeam
trees:
these
were
tall
palms,
and
they
were
growing,
like
the
trees
in
oxford,
in
a
row
along
the
grass.
but
this
was
the
center
of
a
broad
boulevard,
and
at
the
side
of
the
boulevard
was
a
line
of
cafes
and
small
shops,
all
brightly
lit,
all
open,
and
all
utterly
silent
and
empty
beneath
a
sky
thick
with
stars.
the
hot
night
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
with
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea.
all
life;s
battles
teach
us
something,
even
those
we
lose.
when
you
grow
up,
you;ll
discover
that
you
have
defended
lies,
deceived
yourself,
or
suffered
foolishness.
if
you;re
a
good
warrior
you
will
not
blame
yourself
for
this,
but
neither
will
you
allow
your
mistakes
to
repeat
themselves.
is
that
what
your
little
note
says?
it
must
be
hard
living
your
life
off
a
couple
of
scraps
of
paper.
you
mix
your
laundry
list
with
your
grocery
list
you;ll
end
up
eating
your
underwear
for
breakfast.
this
place
is
like
somebody;s
memory
of
a
town,
and
the
memory
is
fading.
it;s
like
there
was
never
anything
here
but
jungle.
and
i
don;t
want
the
world
to
see
me
;cause
i
don;t
think
that
they;d
understand.
when
everything;s
meant
to
be
broken,
i
just
want
you
to
know
who
i
am.
i
was
with
a
customer.
she
interrupts
me,
wild-eyed,
begging
for
coffee,
so
i
tell
her
to
wait
her
turn.
then
she
starts
following
me
around,
talking
a
mile
a
minute,
saying
god
knows
what.
so
finally
i
turn
to
her,
and
i
tell
her
she;s
being
annoying
-
sit
down,
shut
up,
i;ll
get
to
her
when
i
get
to
her.
oh
danny
boy,
the
pipes,
the
pipes
are
calling
from
glen
to
glen,
and
down
the
mountain
side.
the
summer;s
gone,
and
all
the
roses
falling.
it;s
you,
it;s
you
must
go
and
i
must
bide,
but
come
ye
back
when
summer;s
in
the
meadow,
or
when
the
valley;s
hushed
and
white
with
snow.
i;ll
be
here
in
sunshine
or
in
shadow.
oh
danny
boy,
oh
danny
boy,
i
love
you
so.
i
know,
i
know.
now
you;re
going
to
deny
it.
even
though
it;s
ludicrously
obvious
to
everyone
around
you,
you
two
will
go
on
pretending
it;s
not
true
because
you;re
emotional
infants.
you;re
in
a
living
hell.
you
love
each
other
and
you
hate
each
other
and
you
hate
yourselves
for
loving
each
other.
well,
my
dear
friends,
i
want
no
part
of
it.
it;s
time
i
just
picked
up
where
i
left
off.
it;s
time
to
put
humpty
dumpty
back
together
again.
so
i;ll
get
out
of
here
so
you
can
just
get
on
with
your
denial
fest.
do
we
have
to
put
up
with
this?
i
mean,
can;t
we
get
a
better
actor?
i
know
it;s
a
small
part,
but
i
think
we
can
do
better
than
this.
you
know,
sweetheart,
if
there;s
one
thing
i;ve
learned,
it;s
this:
nobody
knows
what;s
gonna
happen
at
the
end
of
the
line,
so
you
might
as
well
enjoy
the
trip.
and
so,
does
the
destination
matter?
or
is
it
the
path
we
take?
i
declare
that
no
accomplishment
has
substance
nearly
as
great
as
the
road
used
to
achieve
it.
we
are
not
creatures
of
destinations.
it
is
the
journey
that
shapes
us.
our
callused
feet,
our
backs
strong
from
carrying
the
weight
of
our
travels,
our
eyes
open
with
the
fresh
delight
of
experiences
lived.
yeah.
well,
if
the
flash
were
my
son,
i;d
tell
him
a
few
things.
first
off,
i;d
tell
him
it;s
a
dangerous
world,
so
be
careful.
then
i;d
tell
him
he;s
a
hero,
and
he;s
saving
a
lot
of
lives.
but
the
most
important
thing
for
him
to
know,
i
feel,
is
that
his
father;s
proud
of
him.
you
ponce
in
here,
expecting
to
be
handwaited
on
hand
and
foot
while
i;m
trying
to
run
a
hotel
here!
have
you
any
idea
of
how
much
there
is
to
do?
do
you
ever
think
of
that?
of
course
not!
you;re
too
busy
sticking
your
noses
into
every
corner,
poking
about
for
things
to
complain
about,
aren;t
you?
i;d
always
loved
the
house
and
its
pretty
white
facade,
the
crisp
black
shutters
framing
the
windows,
the
tawny
cedar
shingles
on
the
roof;
an
old
oak
tree
just
to
the
right
of
the
house
in
the
front
yard,
exactly
where
it
should
be,
a
rope
swing
hanging
from
its
limbs.
nothing
can
be
surprising
anymore
or
impossible
or
miraculous,
now
that
zeus,
father
of
the
olympians,
has
made
night
out
of
noonday,
hiding
the
bright
sunlight,
and
fear
has
come
upon
mankind.
after
this,
men
can
believe
anything,
expect
anything.
don;t
any
of
you
be
surprised
in
future
if
land
beasts
change
places
with
dolphins
and
go
to
live
in
their
salty
pastures,
and
get
to
like
the
sounding
waves
of
the
sea
more
than
the
land,
while
the
dolphins
prefer
the
mountains.
there
are
certain
queer
times
and
occasions
in
this
strange
mixed
affair
we
call
life
when
a
man
takes
this
whole
universe
for
a
vast
practical
joke,
though
the
wit
thereof
he
but
dimly
discerns,
and
more
than
suspects
that
the
joke
is
at
nobody;s
expense
but
his
own.
out
of
another
i
get
a
lovely
view
of
the
bay
and
a
little
private
wharf
belonging
to
the
estate.
there
is
a
beautiful
shaded
lane
that
runs
down
there
from
the
house.
i
always
fancy
i
see
people
walking
in
these
numerous
paths
and
arbors,
but
john
has
cautioned
me
not
to
give
way
to
fancy
in
the
least.
he
says
that
with
my
imaginative
power
and
habit
of
story-making,
a
nervous
weakness
like
mine
is
sure
to
lead
to
all
manner
of
excited
fancies,
and
that
i
ought
to
use
my
will
and
good
sense
to
check
the
tendency.
so
i
try.
i
hope
you
realize
i;m
holding
you
personally
responsible
for
any
and
all
damages
done
to
these
premises!
except
of
course
for
the
spoon
that
got
caught
in
the
garbage
disposal.
i
don;t
think
i
can
blame
him
for
that.
running
was
always
a
big
thing
in
our
family,
specially
running
away
from
the
police.
it;s
hard
to
understand.
all
i
know
is
that
you;ve
got
to
run,
running
without
knowing
why,
through
fields
and
woods.
and
the
winning
post;s
no
end,
even
though
the
barmy
crowds
might
be
cheering
themselves
daft.
that;s
what
the
loneliness
of
a
long
distance
runner
feels
like.
somebody
once
told
me
the
world
is
gonna
roll
me,
i
ain;t

looking
kind
of

the

coming

much
to

what;s
wrong
with

come
a

the
funny
thing
is,
on

i
was
an
honest

straight
as

may

to
protect

you?
this

reads

do
you
suppose
it
doesn;t

everything
about
mental
injury?
do
you
suppose
that
if
asked
a
question,
it
wouldn;t
give
exactly
that
answer

wants
to

wouldn;t
any

what
looks

up

that

not

way
to

to

the
idea
is
that
occasionally
a

that

i
deal
with

first,
there;s
the
very
willing
participant
who
came
to
see
me
hoping
he;d
be
selected.
second,
there;s
the
wise
guy
who
wants
to
prove
he
can;t
be
hypnotized.
third,
there;s
the
person
who
simply
wants
to
enjoy
the
show.
it;s
up
to
me
to
select
the
right
candidate.
i;m
a
good
man,

on
the
table,

jobs,

and
able,

good
man,
up
having
fun,
got
no
kids
and
i
love
the
lord,
check.
good
man,
i;m
monogamous,
never
did
time
well,
maybe
just
once,
check.

man
and
i
puts
it
down,
wanna
say
it
twice
but
i
puts
it
down,
check.
how
could
you
ever
walk
away
after
all
i;ve
done
for
you?
i
feel
like
there;s
a
knife
in
my
back,
babe.
you
might
as
well
put
it
all
the
way
through,
good
man.
to
feel
it
so
like
myself,
indeed,
so
brotherly,
made
me
realize
that
i;d
been
happy,
and
that
i
was
happy
still.
for
all
to
be
accomplished,
for
me
to
feel
less
lonely,
all
that
remained
to
hope
was
that
on
the
day
of
my
execution
there
should
be
a
huge
crowd
of
spectators
and
that
they
should
greet
me
with
howls
of
execration.

it
should
have
been
more
dramatic.

i
read
that

you
gonna

the
whole
thing
for

do
you
have
any
thoughts
of
your
own
on
this
matter?
or
do
you,

that
your
thing,
you
come
into
a
bar,
read
some
obscure
passage
and
then
pretend
-
you
pawn
it
off
as
your
own,
as
your
own
idea
just
to
impress
some

embarrass
my
friend?
dani
felt
as
if
a
path
had
appeared
in

of

it
was

and
offered
a
way
out,
up
and
away.
but
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
taking
the
first
step.
it
would
mean
leaping

gulf

he;d
fallen

never
be

nothing

faster
than
the
thought
of

devil
snapping
at
their
heels.
maybe
that
was
god;s
plan
all
along,
why
he
created
him,
allowed
him
to
fall
from
grace
-
to
become
a
symbol
to
be
feared,
a
warning
to
us

do
you
believe
in

that;s
a
complicated
question.
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"god".
you
see,
it
helps
no
one
to
be
reductive.
i
believe
that
we
are
here
implies
to
some
degree
that
there
are
forces
larger
than
us.
now,
we
can
get
into
the
semanticalities...
the
very
notion
of
belief
itself
can
be
rhetorically
whittled
to
the
bare
nub
of
its
meaning.
i;d
like
to
talk
to
you
a
lot
more
about
this.
would
you
be
interested
in
reading
some
of
my
literature?
my
face,
body,
lifestyle.
i
chose
every
aspect
of
myself
with
my
own
will.
i
don;t
want
to
be
ordered
around
by
anyone
anymore,
and
i
have
no
need
for
a
past.
i;ve
got
dreams
to
fulfill,
money
to
earn,
love
to
find,
and
success
to
achieve.
they
may
be
foolishly
simplistic
desires
for
some,
but
to
me,
working
towards
them

by

is
how
i
build
my
confidence.

we
are
going
after

-

it
from

you.
now,
treasure
is
a
ticklish
work;
i
don;t
like
treasure
voyages
on
any
account,
and
i
don;t
like
them,
above
all,
when
they
are
secret
and
when
(begging
your
pardon,
mr.
trelawney)
the
secret
has
been
told
to

manuel...
my
wife
informs
me
that
you;re...
depressed.
let
me
tell
you
something.
depression
is
a
very
bad
thing.
it;s
like
a
virus.
if
you
don;t
stamp
on
it,
it
spreads
throughout
the
mind,
and
then
one
day
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
you...
you
can;t
face

any
more!
it
is

what

your
money
away
on
short,
get-rich-quick

binges.
it
is
an
obvious
lesson,
but
one
frequently
ignored.
do
not

i;m
so
into
you,
i
can
barely
breathe.
and
all
i
want
to
do,
is
to
fall
in

but
close
ain;t
close
enough,
till
we
cross
the
line.
so
name
a
game
to
play,
and
i;ll
roll
the
dice.
salvation

grow

the

keeps
me
wanting
you,
missing
you.
just
to
picture
you
is
what
gets
me
through.
your
light
shines
so
bright
it;s
like

evening
of

i

smiling
faces
i
can
see,
but
not
for
me.
i
sit
and
watch
as
tears
go
by.
i
mean
that
tonight
you;ve
made
me
ashamed
of
every
concept
i
ever
had
of
superior
or
inferior
beings.
but
i
thank
you
for
that
shame,
because
now
i
know
that
we
are
each
of
us
a
separate
human
being,
brandon,
with
the
right
to
live
and
work
and
think
as
individuals,
but
with
an
obligation
to
the
society
we
live
in.
we
call
ourselves
runners.
we
exist
on
the
edge
between
the
gloss
and
the
reality:
the
mirror;s
edge.
we
keep
out
of
trouble,
out
of
sight,
and
the
cops
don;t
bother
us.
runners
see
the
city
in
a
different
way.
we
see
the
flow.
rooftops
become
pathways
and
conduits,
possibilities
and
routes
of
escape.
the
flow
is
what
keeps
us
running,
keeps
us
alive.
the
big
question
for
the
future
of
humanity
is
whether
that
filter
lies
behind
us
-
in
the
evolution
of
intelligence,
for
instance
-
or
ahead
of
us:
perhaps
any
sufficiently
technologically
advanced
species
will
eventually
destroy
itself
through
war
or
pollution.
alternatively,
it
might
be
that
space
and
time
are
simply
too
big.
maybe
the
universe
is
full
of
voices
that
we
will
never
hear
because
they
are
too
far
away
or
too
long
ago.
i
am
forever
your
debtor
for
reminding
me
of
that
curious
passage
in
my
life.
during
the
first
year
or
two
after
it
happened,
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it.
my
pain
and
shame
were
so
intense,
and
my
sense
of
having
been
an
imbecile
so
settled,
established
and
confirmed,
that
i
drove
the
episode
entirely
from
my
mind
-
and
so
all
these
twenty-eight
or
twenty-nine
years
i
have
lived
in
the
conviction
that
my
performance
of
that
time
was
coarse,
vulgar,
and
destitute
of
humor.
in
fact,
the
americans
of
1776
enjoyed
a
higher
standard
of
living
than
any
people
in
the
world.
their
material
wealth
was
considerably
less
than
it
would
become
in
time,
still
it
was
a
great
deal
more
than
others
had
elsewhere.
how
people
with
so
much,
living
on
their
own
land,
would
ever
choose
to
rebel
against
the
ruler
god
had
put
over
them
and
thereby
bring
down
such
devastation
upon
themselves
was
for
the
invaders
incomprehensible.
if
at
first
you
don;t
succeed,
destroy
any
evidence
that
you
ever
tried.
we;re
leaving
together,
but
still
it;s
farewell.
and
maybe
we;ll
come
back
to
earth,
who
can
tell?
i
guess
there
is
no
one
to
blame.
we;re
leaving
ground.
will
things
ever
be
the

my
old
man
back
in

when
i
was

he

to

in

he
puts

what
seemed

yesterday
are

today.

who
talks
about

anymore?
today
we
are
already
on
the
threshold
of
conquering
our
galaxy,
and
in
a
not
too
distant
tomorrow,
we;ll
be
considering
the
conquest
of
the
universe,
and
yet
man
seems
to
ignore
the
fact
that
on
this
very
planet
there
are
still
people
living
in
the
stone
age
and
practicing
cannibalism.
for
centuries,
human
society
has
taken
the
gifts
of
nature
for

as
civilizations
grew,
humans
spread
out
across
the
face
of
the
planet,
taking
what
they
needed
from
the
land
and
producing
more
and
more
waste
materials
with
little
regard
for
the
future.
there;s
an
infestation
in
my
mind;s

i

they

on

;cause
i;m

the

just
writing
to
say
something
;cause
i
wasn;t
the
only
one
who
wasn;t
rushing
to
say
nothing.
this
doesn;t
mean
i
lost
my

it;s
just
right
now
i
got
a
really
crazy

you
don;t

i
wanted
to
be

i
wanted
to

of

i
wanted
the

i
wanted

"hi,
i

i;ve
never
been

i;ve
lost

i;ll

do
you
understand
me?
too
often
writers
believe
that
they
can
emphasize
words
by
putting
them
in
all
capital
letters.
the
only
problem
is
that
when
all
capital
letters
are
used,
the
ability
to
read
the
words
is
reduced
dramatically
because
all
the
letters
are
rectangles.
a
more
effective
way
to
emphasize
words
is
sparingly
to
use
bold,
italics,
underline,
and
combinations
of
these
styles.

you;ll

we

forever
emitting
sparks
of

so
let;s
spark
together.
in
every
mind
there
is
a
piece
of
code
that
operates
our
creative
functions.
it
forms
a
conduit
called
a
cerebrum-bilical
that
extends
to
the
farthest
reaches
of
imagination...
so
let;s
build!
together
we
can
push
back
the
boundaries
until
they
are
a

on
the

i
used
to
bite
my
tongue
and
hold
my
breath,
scared
to
rock
the

and
make
a

so
i
sat
quietly,
agreed
politely.
i
guess
that
i
forgot
i
had
a
choice.
i
let
you
push
me
past
the
breaking
point.
i
stood
for
nothing,
so
i
fell
for
everything.
yes,
i
have
tricks
in
my
pocket,
i
have
things
up
my
sleeve.
but
i
am
the
opposite
of
a
stage
magician.

it;s
the
loneliest
feeling
in
the
world
to
find
yourself
standing
up
when
everybody
else
is
sitting
down.
to
have
everybody
look
at
you
and
say,
"what;s
the
matter
with
him?"
i
know.
i
know
what
it
feels

the
really
important
kind
of
freedom
involves
attention,

and

and

and
being
able

about
other

to
sacrifice
for

a
firm
anchor
of
something

i;ve
met
another
man.
he;s
the
best
man
i;ve
ever
met.
he;s
bright,
handsome
and
he;s
crazy
about
me.
and,
he;s
married.
there;s
only
one
thing;
he
doesn;t

pretty

if
you
don;t
stop
and
look
around
once
in

you
could
miss

if
anything
in
this
life
is
certain,
if
history
has
taught
us
anything,
it
is
that
you
can
kill
anyone.
harvey
and
i
have
things
to
do.
we
sit
in
bars,
have
a
drink
or
two,
play
the
jukebox.
very
soon
the
faces
of
all
the
other
people
turn
towards
me,
and
they
smile.
they
say,
"we
don;t
know
your
name,
mister,
but
you;re
a
very
nice
fellow."
harvey
and
i
warm
ourselves
in
these
golden
moments.
we
came
as
strangers;
soon
we
have
friends.
they
come
over,
they
sit
with
us,
they
drink
with
us,
they
talk
to
us.
they
tell
us
about
the
great
big
terrible
things
they;ve
done
and
the
great
big
wonderful
things
they;re
going
to
do.
their

their
regrets.
their
loves,
their
hates.

very
large,
because
nobody
ever
brings
anything
small
to
a
bar.
now
calm
down.
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
go
on
with
our
daily
routine.
i
still
see
things
that
are
not
here.
i
just
choose
not
to
acknowledge
them.
like
a
diet
of
the
mind,
i
just
choose
not
to
indulge
certain
appetites;
like
my
appetite
for
patterns;
perhaps
my
appetite
to
imagine
and
to
dream.
well,
that;s
all
the
time
we
had
for
our
movie.
we
hope
you
found
it
entertaining,
whimsical
and
yet
relevant,
with
an
underlying
revisionist
conceit
that
belied
the
film;s
emotional
attachments
to
the
subject

if
you;re
distracted
by
fear
of
those

it
keeps
you
from
seeing
the

not
a
mech,
but
you;re
enough
of
a
machine
to
need

and
then.

you

some
bioelectric

i;ve
been
on
a
diet
every
day
since
i
was
nineteen,
which
basically
means
i;ve
been
hungry
for
a
decade.
i;ve
had
a
series
of
not
nice
boyfriends,
one
of
whom
hit
me.
ah,
and
every
time
i
get
my
heart
broken,
the
newspapers
splash
it
about
as
though
it;s
entertainment.
and
it;s
taken
two
rather
painful
operations
to
get
me
looking
like
this.
and,
one
day
not
long
from
now,
my
looks
will
go,
they
will
discover
i
can;t
act
and
i
will
become
some
sad
middle-aged
woman
who
looks
a
bit
like
someone
who
was
famous
for
a
while.

what
are
we
living
for?
abandoned
places,
i
guess
we
know
the
score.
on
and
on,

anybody
know
what
we
are
looking
for?
another
hero,
another
mindless

behind
the

in
the
pantomime.

a
"stable
and

goal.
most
of
our
goals
are
mundane
and
immediate,
like
getting
to
work
on

going
to
the
gym,
or
doing
the

purpose,
by
contrast,
is
a
goal
toward
which
we
are
always
working.
it
is
the
forward-pointing
arrow
that
motivates
our
behavior
and
serves
as
the
organizing
principle
of
our
lives.
i
maintain
that
inversion
is
the
effect
of
neither
a
prenatal
choice
nor
an
endocrinal
malformation
nor
even
the
passive
and
determined
result
of

it
is
an

a

discovers

he

i
always
wanted

it

just
so
interesting
to
me
that
a

could
make
me

frightened,
so
scared,
so
sick,
so
excited,
and
so
thrilled

together!

i;m

you;ll
see
me
as
i

above
all,
i
wouldn;t
want
people
to
think
that
i
want
to
prove

i
don;t

i
just
want
to

i

your

that

one
day
in
boston,
i
was
in
harvard
square.
i
saw
a
cover
of
popular
electronics
with
this
thing
that
looked
like
what
i
had
been
imagining,
and
so
i
grabbed
it
off
the
shelf,
i
looked
at
it
and
i
bought
it
and
i
ran
back
to
bill;s
dorm,
and
i
think
he
was
probably
playing
poker
that
night
and
usually
losing
money
at
that
point.

of
the
few
times
when
that;s

the

certainly
the
determining
acts
of
her
life
were
not
ideally
beautiful.
they
were
the
mixed
result
of
young
and
novel
impulse
struggling
amidst
the
conditions
of
an
imperfect
social
state,
in
which
great
feelings
will
often
take
the
aspect
of
error,
and
great
faith
the
aspect
of
illusion.
for
one
who
contradicts
emptiness
there
would
be
nothing
that

to
be
done;
activity
would
be

an

would
be
non-acting.

the

is

it;s
not

can
apply

existing
physical

useful
things,
like

of
the

important
theoretical

i
nearly
lost
you
on
our
wedding
day.
it
was
early

and
you
were
leaving
from

with
your
best
friend
when
your
vehicle
careened
into
an
suv
as
it
turned
out
in
front
of
you,
violently
flinging
you
into
the
waiting
airbag.
you
were
shaken
and
dazed,
but
otherwise
okay
and
still
determined
to
get
married.
when
i
watched
you
walking
down
the
aisle,
you
were
glowing.
the
scrapes
and
bruises
only
made
you
more
beautiful.

there;s

we
can
never
really
know

except
by
our
first
glance
at
him.
because,
in
that
glance,
we
know
everything.

to
unravel

flesh-and-blood
human
being
to
go
on
living
with
such
feelings.
that
is
why
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
fasten
your
feelings
to
the
earth
-
firmly,
like
attaching
an
anchor
to
a
balloon.
the
money
is
for
that.
to
prevent
you
from
feeling
that
you
can
do
anything
you
want
as
long
as
it;s
the
right
thing
and
your
feelings
are
pure.
my
meaning
simply
is,
that
whatever
i
have
tried
to
do
in
life,
i
have
tried
with
all
my
heart
to
do
well;
that
whatever
i
have
devoted
myself
to,
i
have
devoted
myself
to
completely;
that
in
great
aims
and
in
small,
i
have
always
been
thoroughly
in
earnest.
even
if
it;s
a
dumb
story,
telling
it
changes
people
just
the
slightest
little
bit,
just
as
living
the
story
changes
me.
an
infinitesimal
change.
and
that
infinitesimal
change
ripples
outward
-
ever
smaller
but
everlasting.
i
will
get
forgotten,
but
the
stories
will
last.
and
so
we
all
matter
-
maybe
less
than
a
lot,
but
always
more
than
none.
must
the
citizen
ever
for
a
moment,
or
in
the
least
degree,
resign
his
conscience
to
the
legislator?
why
has
every
man
a
conscience
then?
i
think
that
we
should
be
men
first,
and
subjects
afterward.
it
is
not
desirable
to
cultivate
a
respect
for
the
law,
so
much
as
for
the

the
only
obligation
which
i
have
a
right
to
assume
is
to
do
at
any

what
i

but,
pray
how
could
that
which
i
spoke
so
many
years
ago,
and
at
about
five
thousand
leagues
distance,
in
another
reign,
be
applied

of

man
you
can
always
trust
to

it;s
the
honest
ones
you
want
to
watch
out
for,

you
can
never

when
they;re
going
to
do
something
incredibly
stupid.
memories,
even
your
most
precious
ones,
fade
surprisingly
quickly.
but
i
don;t
go
along
with
that.
the

i

most,
i
don;t
ever
see
them
fading.

the
truth
is
that
this

is
dealing
with
his

go

kill
the
only
man
i
ever
cared
for.
now
i
will
tell
you
the
answer
to
my
question.
it
is
this.
the
party
seeks
power
entirely
for
its
own
sake.
we
are
not
interested
in
the
good
of
others;
we
are
interested
solely
in
power,
pure
power.
what
pure
power
means
you
will
understand
presently.
we
are
different
from
the
oligarchies
of
the
past
in
that
we
know
what
we
are
doing.
all
the
others,
even
those
who
resembled
ourselves,
were
cowards
and
hypocrites.
there
is
so
much
darkness
in
ember,
lina.
it;s
not
just
outside,
it;s
inside
us,
too.
everyone
has
some
darkness
inside.
it;s
like
a
hungry
creature.
it
wants
and
wants
and
wants
with
a
terrible
power.
and
the
more
you
give
it,
the
bigger
and
hungrier
it
gets.
every
pause
in
our
talk
was
filled
by
the
sound
of
deep,
loud
chanting
coming
from
a
tent
hard
by.
presently
i
went
out
to
see
them
at
their
evening
service.
a
big
tent
was
full
of
men
squatting
around,
the
short
twilight
was
fast
darkening
into
night
outside,
and
the
interior
of
the
tent
was
lit
by
two
candles
stuck
in
the
necks
of
bottles.
except
a
couple
of
old
men,
they
were
all
in
the
prime
of
life,
and
a
splendidly
strong-looking
set
of
fellows
they
were.
they
sang,
without
any
drawl
or
nasal
intonation,
straight
out
from
their
deep
chests.
the
protozoa,
or
one-celled
animals,
belonged
to
an
unknown
world
before
the
invention
of
the
microscope.
the
first
of
these
instruments
enabled
the
early
observers
to
see
some
of
the
larger
and
more
conspicuous
members
of
the
group
and
each
improvement
of
the
microscope
has
enabled
us
to
see
more
and
more
of
them
and
to
study
in
detail
not
only
the
structure
but
to
follow
the
life-history
of
many
of
them.
can
we
love
until
there;s
nothing
left
and
we;re

the

of
our
golden

we;re
flecks
of

love
so
deep,
nothing

like
it.

they

cross
my
heart,
that
i;ll
die
for
you.
cross
my
heart
that
i;ll
always
keep
you.
cross
my
heart
like
a
bittersweet
tattoo.
but
suddenly,
i
viddied
that
thinking
was
for
the
gloopy
ones,
and
that
the
oomny
ones
use
like,
inspiration
and
what
bog
sends.
now
it
was
lovely
music
that
came
into
my
aid.
there
was
a
window
open
with
the
stereo
on,
and
i
viddied
right
at
once
what
to
do.
so
a
rich
little
man
with
white
hair
died.
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
price
of
rice,
right?
and
why
is
that
woe
to
us?
because
you
people,
and
sixty-two
million
other
americans,
are
listening
to
me
right
now.
because
less
than
three
percent
of
you
people
read
books!
because
less
than
fifteen
percent
of
you
read
newspapers!
because
the
only
truth
you
know
is
what
you
get
over
this
tube.
nowadays
people
know
the
price
of
everything
and
the
value
of
nothing.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
available
men
(and
more
than
enough
who
are
not
"available,"
but
will
still
try)
of
varying
quality,
that
you
can
choose
from,
but
the
odds
are
that
you
will
generally
meet
the
worst
of
them.
oh
dear
god,
i
don;t
feel
alive.
when
you;re
cut
short
of
misery.
will
you
pray
it
be
the
end?
give
a
look
surprised,
wide
eyes
to
me.
then
you;ll
know
just
what
i
am.
the
scare
that
triggers
your
fear.
come
know
me
in
a
different
light
now.
come
know
me
as
god.
time
is
dead
as
long
as
it
is
being
clicked
off
by
little
wheels;
only
when
the
clock
stops
does
time
come
to
life.
i;m
so
in
love
with
you.
and
i
hope
you
know,
darling,
your
love
is
more
than
worth
its
weight
in
gold.
we;ve
come
so
far,
my
dear.
look
how
we;ve
grown.
and
i
wanna
stay
with
you
until
we;re
grey
and
old.
just
say
you
won;t
let
go.
we
would
ride
up
the
avenue,
but
we
haven;t
got
the
price.
we
would
skate
up
the
avenue,
but
there
isn;t
any
ice.
we
would
ride
on
a
bicycle,
but
we
haven;t
got
a
bike.
so
we;ll
walk
up
the
avenue,
yes,
we;ll
walk
up
the
avenue,
and
to
walk
up
the
avenue;s
what
we
like.
to
find
out
if
she
really
loved
me,
i
hooked
her
up
to
a
lie
detector.
and
just
as
i
suspected,
my
machine
was
broken.
i
took
a
course
in
art
last
winter.
i
learnt
the
difference
between
a
fine
oil
painting,
and
a
mechanical
thing,
like
a
photograph.
the
photograph
shows
only
the
reality.
the
painting
shows
not
only
the
reality,
but
the
dream
behind
it.
it;s
our
dreams,
doctor,
that
carry
us
on.
they
separate
us
from
the
beasts.
i
learned
this,
at
least,
by
my
experiment:
that
if
one
advances
confidently
in
the
direction
of
his
dreams,
and
endeavors
to
live
the
life
which
he
has
imagined,
he
will
meet
with
a
success
unexpected
in
common
hours.
i
don;t
know
why
i
did
the
things
i
did.
i
don;t
know
why
i
said
the
things
i
said.
and
there
was
value
in
the
thing,
clearly,
that
they
were
certain
of.
but
what
is
the
application?
in
a
matter
of
hours,
they
had
given
it
into
everything
from
mass
transit
to
satellite
launching,
imagining
devices
the
size
of
jumbo
jets.
everything
would
be
cheaper.
it
was
practical,
and
they
knew
it.
but
above
all
that,
beyond
the
positives,
they
knew
that
the
easiest
way
to
be
exploited
is
to
sell
something
they
did
not
yet
understand.
so
they
kept
quiet.
living
close
to
the
ground
is
seventh
heaven
;cause
there
are
angels
all
around.
among
my
frivolous
thoughts,
i
believe
there
are
beautiful
things
seen
by
the
astronauts.
the
indications
reveal
that
few
of
us
realize
life
is
quite
surreal.
so
if
you;re
dying
to
see,
i
guarantee
there
are
angels
around
your
vicinity.
hain;t
we
got
all
the
fools
in
town
on
our
side?
and
hain;t
that
a
big
enough
majority
in
any
town?
a
new
disease
has
fallen
on
the
life
of
man.
our
torment
is
unbelief,
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
we
ought
to
do;
the
distrust
of
the
value
of
what
we
do,
and
the
distrust
that
the
necessity
is
fair
and
beneficent.
everything
we
do
is
a
choice.
oatmeal
or
cereal.
highway
or
side
streets.
kiss
her
or
keep
her.
we
make
choices
and
we
live
with
the
consequences.
if
someone
gets
hurt
along
the
way
we
ask
for
forgiveness.
it;s
the
best
anyone
can
do.
like
if
you
met
me
you
wouldn;t
think
i
was
the
weird
kid
who
spent
time
in
the
hospital.
and
i
wouldn;t
make
you
nervous.
i
hope
it;s
okay
for
me
to
think
that.
you
see,
i
haven;t
really
talked
to
anyone
outside
of
my
family
all
summer.
but
tomorrow
is
my
first
day
of
high
school
ever
and
i
need
to
turn
things
around.
so
i
have
a
plan.
as
i
enter
the
school
for
the
first
time
i
will
visualize
what
it
would
be
like
on
the
last
day
of
my
senior
year.
unfortunately
i
counted
and
that;s
1385
days.
we
all
carry
around
so
much
pain
in
our
hearts.
love
and
pain
and
beauty.
they
all
seem
to
go
together
like
one
little
tidy
confusing
package.
it;s
a
messy
business,
life.
it;s
hard
to
figure
-
full
of
surprises.
some
good.
some
bad.
there
is
more
than
one
kind
of
freedom:
freedom
to
and
freedom
from.
in
the
days
of
anarchy,
it
was
freedom
to.
now
you
are
being
given
freedom
from.
don;t
underrate
it.
i;m
a
beatbox
rocker.
and
you;re
dancing
to
my
beat.
i;m
a
beatbox
rocker.
and
you;re
dancing
to
my
beat.
i;m
a
beatbox
rocker.
and
you;re
dancing
to
my
beat.
i;m
a
beatbox
rocker.
and
i
never
sound
the
same.
resistance
is
the
measurement
of
the
ability
of
electrons
to
move
through
a
material.
a
copper
wire
with
a
large
diameter
has
lower
resistance
to
the
flow
of
electrons
than
a
copper
wire
with
a
small
diameter.
you
need
to
understand
resistance
because
almost
every
electronics
project
you
do
involves
a
resistor.
resistors
have
controlled
amounts
of
resistance,
which
allows
you
to
control
the
flow
of
electrons
in
a
circuit.
i
hope
that
our
few
remaining
friends
give
up
on
trying
to
save
us.
i
hope
we
come
up
with
a
fail-safe
plot
to
piss
off
the
dumb
few
that
forgave
us.
i
hope
the
fences
we
mended
fall
down
beneath
their
own
weight,
and
i
hope
we
hang
on
past
the
last
exit.
i
hope
it;s
already
too
late.
he
didn;t
reject
the
idea
so
much
as
not
react
to
it
and
watch
as
it
floated
away.
he
thought
very
broadly
of
desires
and
ideas
being
watched
but
not
acted

he
thought
of

being
starved

out

with

up

i
don;t

had
to
close

cruel,

is
so
careless
and
confident
she
doesn;t
even
trouble
to
sheathe
her
claws.
and
i
know
of
people
that;ve
been
coming
up
to
me,
and
making
me
talk
about
how,
you
know,
benjamin,
why
is
it
so
that,
you
know,
you;re
young,
but
you
already
seem
very
dark,
and
you
seem
to
be
almost
possessed.
quite
telling,
that;s
quite
funny.
;cause
while
i;m
on
my
journey,
figuring
things
out,
i
do
come
across,
surprisingly,
angels;
they
come
to
me
and
they
sing
to
me
so
beautifully,
and
if
i
can
recall
very
clearly,
their
melodies
go
something
like
this.
and
then
there
was
you,
all
red
curls
and
smiles,
stepping
up
to
buy
your
ticket,
and
the
warmth
rose
through
me
like
helium
to
my
brain.
you
were
wet
today.
shivering.
you
smelt
of
disinfectant,
stronger
than
any
other
work-smell
on
the

is
it
legal
for
you
to
work
there?

he
felt
that
he
could
not
divert
people;s
hatred
from
himself,
because
the
reason
for
that
hatred
was
not
that
he
was
bad
(then
he
could
have
tried
to
be
better),
but
that
he
was
shamefully
and
repulsively
unhappy.
for
that,
for
the
very
fact
that
his
heart
was
wounded,
they
would
be
merciless
towards
him,
as
dogs
kill
a
wounded
dog
howling
with
pain.
when
i
was
younger,
so
much
younger
than
today,
i
never
needed
anybody;s
help
in
any
way.
but
now
these
days
are
gone,
i;m
not
so
self-assured.
now
i
find
i;ve
changed
my
mind,
i;ve
opened
up
the
doors.
well,
i
heard
my
friends
really
got
in
a
mess
so
i;m
gonna
have
to
leave
yoda,
i
guess.
but
i
know
that
i;ll
be
coming
back
some
day.
i;ll
be
playing
this
part
till
i;m
old
and
gray.
the
long-term
contract
that
i
had
to
sign
says
i;ll
be
making
these
movies
till
the
end
of
time.
and
i
will
strike
down
upon
thee
with
great
vengeance
and
furious
anger
those
who
would
attempt
to
poison
and
destroy
my
brothers.
and
you
will
know
my
name
is
the
lord
when
i
lay
my
vengeance
upon
thee.
i;ve
been
down,
now
i;m
blessed.
i
felt
a
revelation
coming
around.
i
guess
it;s
right,
it;s
so
amazing,
every
time
i
see
you
i;m
alive.
you;re
all
i;ve
got,
you
lift
me
up.
the
sun
and
the
moonlight,
all
my
dreams
are
in
your
eyes.
is
there
a
cure
among
us
from
this
processed
sanity?
i
weaken
with
each
voice
that
sings.
now
in
this
world
of
purchase,
i;m
going
to
buy
back
memories
to
awaken
some
old
quality.
all
children
have
to
be
deceived
if
they
are
to
grow
up
without
trauma.
i;ve
seen
things
you
people
wouldn;t
believe.
attack
ships
on
fire
off
the
shoulder
of
orion.
i
watched
c-beams
glitter
in
the
dark
near
the
tannhauser

all
those
moments
will
be
lost
in
time,
like
tears
in
rain.
those
who
reject
the
argument
that
natural
science
has
progressed
and
social
science
has
languished
take
up
their
counterargument
at
the
very
foundations
of
the
philosophy
of
natural
science.
to
begin
with,
it
is
sometimes
held
that
the
natural
sciences
have
not
in
fact
made
the
kind
of
progress
ordinarily
attributed
to
them.
i
think
the
world
divides
neatly
into
those
who
are
excited
by
the
managed
induction
of
terror
and
those
who
are
not.
i
do
not
find
terror
exciting.
i
find
it
terrifying.
one
of
my
basic
goals
is
to
subject
my
nervous
system
to
as
little
total
terror
as
possible.
the
cruel
paradox
of
course
is
that
this
kind
of
makeup
usually
goes
hand
in
hand
with
a
delicate
nervous
system
that;s
extremely
easy
to
terrify.

the
world
is
so
exquisite,
with
so
much
love
and
moral
depth,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
deceive
ourselves
with
pretty
stories
for
which
there;s
little
good
evidence.
far
better,
it
seems
to
me,
in
our
vulnerability,
is
to
look
death
in
the
eye
and
to
be
grateful
every
day
for
the
brief
but
magnificent
opportunity
that
life
provides.
now
that
you;re
out
of
high
school,
which
means
you;re
technically
an

don;t
you

it;s

you
move
on
from
primitive
constructs
such
as
popularity?

was

from
the
depths
of
the
packing

he
suddenly
heard
a
faint
"ork."
his
heart
stood
still.
i
was
giving
up.
i
would
have
given
up
-
if
a
voice
hadn;t
made
itself
heard
in
my
heart.
the
voice
said
"i
will
not
die.
i
refuse
it.
i
will
make
it
through
this
nightmare.
i
will
beat
the
odds,
as
great
as
they
are.
i
have
survived
so
far,
miraculously.
now
i
will
turn
miracle
into
routine.
the
amazing
will
be
seen
every
day.
i
will
put
in
all
the
hard
work
necessary."
technically,
chemistry
is
the
study
of
matter.
but
i
prefer
to
see
it
as
the
study
of
change.
now,
just,
just
think
about
this.
electrons
change
their
energy
levels.
molecules
change
their
bonds.
elements
combine
and
change
into
compounds.
well
that;s
all
of
life,
right?
it;s
the
constant,
it;s
the
cycle.
it;s
solution,
dissolution,
over
and
over
and
over.
it
is
growth
then
decay
then
transformation.
it
is
fascinating,
really.
we

only
then,
are
we

is

so
what?
i
had
my
suspicions.
i
always
did.
but
we;re
not
like

people.
we
love
each

you

i;m
sorry
i
made
a

before

you
are
the

am

telling
this
to
you?

therefore
the

the

overthrows
their
kingdom
without

i
am
innocent,
innocent.
i
just
wanted
to
play
a
game,

the
boring

found
such
fun
to
be
a
trouble.
as
punishment,
they
craved
to
imprison
my
body,

i;m
fast,
fast,
clever,

they
lost
the
chase,
and
locked
up
their
entire
race,
building
a
prison
around
the
whole
world.
now,
i;m
the
only
free
one.
i
felt

somnolent,
for

the
more
you
have
the
more
you
want,

you
feel
unhappy,
sated
and
unsated
at
the

time.
you
know
the

between
you
and

i;m

white
trash
cracker
from

white
trash
town

no

would
even
bother
to
piss
on.

here;s
the
difference.
i;ve
made
something
of
myself,
i
have
the
keys
to
the
capitol,
people
respect
me.

you,
you;re
still
nothing.

of
a
rough
time.

there

we

we

we

in

the

we

the
more
exceptional

to

no

are;

i
implore

-
try.

perhaps
however
the
most
satisfactory
definition
of
a
rock
is
an
aggregate
of
mineral
particles.
this
definition
makes
no
assumption
as
to
the
composition
or
state
of
aggregation
of
the
particles
and
hence
may
be
taken
to
include
the
accumulations
of
all
ages
and
of
all
degrees
of
solidification
and
alteration,
without
regard
to
their
manner
of
formation.
well,
why
waste
this
on
us
when
you
can
put
it
on
the

and
have
the

ignore
it?
once
upon
a
time,
at
the
foot
of
a
great
mountain,
there
was
a
town
where
the
people
known
as
happy
folk
lived,
their
very
existence
a
mystery
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
obscured
as
it
was
by
great
clouds.
here
they
played
out
their
peaceful
lives,
innocent
to
the
litany
of
excessive
violence
that
was
growing
in
the
world
below
-
to
live
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
the
mountain,
called
monkey,
was
enough.
then
one
day,
strange
folk
arrived
in
the
town.
they
came
in
camouflage,
hidden
behind
dark
glasses,
but
no
one
noticed
them.
they
only
saw
shadows,
you
see.
without
the
truth
to
the
eyes,
the
happy
folk
were
blind.
usually
rockslides
take
place
in
a
geologic
setting
where
the
rock
strata
are
inclined,
or
where
joints
and
fractures
exist
parallel
to
the
slope.
when
such
a
rock
unit
is
undercut
at
the
base
of
the
slope,
it
loses
support,
and
the
rock
eventually
gives
way.

only
the

of

wide,
goes
on,

against
flatness.
the
sky
appears
so
close
that,
with
a
long-enough
extension
ladder,
you
think
you
could
touch
it,
and
sometimes
you
do,
when
clouds
descend
in
the
night
to
set
a
fine
pelt
of
dew
on
the

behind
white

day
before.
i
think
people
place
too
much
emphasis
on
their
careers.
i
wish
we
could
all
live
in
the
mountains
at
high
altitude.
that;s
where
i
see
myself
in
five
years.
how
about
you?
my
name
is
charlie
bartlett.
if
there;s
one
thing
i
want
you
guys
to
walk
away
with
tonight,
it;s
that
you
guys
don;t
need
me.
i
really
mean
it.
you
think
i;m
any
less
screwed
up
than
you
are?
i
get
up
every
morning
and
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
i
try
and
figure
out
just
where
i
fit
in
and
i
draw
a
complete
blank.
i
remember
when
we
used
to
sit
in
the
government
yard
in
trenchtown.
observing
the
hypocrites
as
they
would
mingle
with
the
good
people
we
meet.
good
friends
we
had,
good
friends
we
lost
along
the
way.
in
this
bright
future
you
can;t
forget
your
past,
so
dry
your
tears,
i
say.
you
lock
the
door,
and
throw
away
the
key.
there;s
someone
in
my
head
but
it;s
not
me.
all
right,
but
apart
from
the
sanitation,
medicine,
education,
wine,
public
order,
irrigation,

the
fresh
water
system
and
public
health,
what
have
the
romans
ever
done
for
us?
someday
he;ll
come
along,
the
man
i
love,
and
he;ll
be
big
and
strong,
the
man
i
love.
and
when
he
comes
my
way,
i;ll
do
my
best
to
make
him
stay.
he;ll
look
at
me
and
smile,
i;ll
understand,
then
in
a
little
while,
he;ll
take
my
hand.
and
though
it
seems
absurd,
i
know
we
both
won;t
say
a
word.
maybe
i
shall
meet
him
sunday,
maybe
monday,
maybe
not.
still
i;m
sure
to
meet
him
one
day,
maybe
tuesday
will
be
my
good
news
day.
add
a
number
to
itself
and
it
changes.
one
and
one
is
not
one
-
it;s
two.
two
and
two
is
four.
but
zero
and
zero
is
zero.
this
violates
the
basic
principle
of
numbers
called
the
axiom
of
archimedes,
which
says
that
if
you
add
something
to
itself
enough
times,
it
will
exceed
any
other
number
in
magnitude.
that
is
the
germ
of
my
great
discovery.
but
you
are
wrong
to
say
that
we
cannot
move
about
in
time.
for
instance,
if
i
am
recalling
an
incident
very
vividly
i
go
back
to
the
instant
of
its
occurrence:
i
become
absent-minded,
as
you
say.
i
jump
back
for
a
moment.
of
course
we
have
no
means
of
staying
back
for
any
length
of
time,
any
more
than
a
savage
or
an
animal
has
of
staying
six
feet
above
the
ground.
but
a
civilized
man
is
better
off
than
the
savage
in
this
respect.
he
can
go
up
against
gravitation
in
a
balloon,
and
why
should
he
not
hope
that
ultimately
he
may
be
able
to
stop
or
accelerate
his
drift
along
the
time-dimension,
or
even
turn
about
and
travel
the
other
way?
to
think
that
the
affairs
of
this
life
always
remain
in
the
same
state
is
a
vain
presumption;
indeed
they
all
seem
to
be
perpetually
changing
and
moving
in
a
circular
course.
spring
is
followed
by
summer,
summer
by
autumn,
and
autumn
by
winter,
which
is
again
followed
by
spring,
and
so
time
continues
its
everlasting
round.
but
the
life
of
man
is
ever
racing
to
its
end,
swifter
than
time
itself,
without
hope
of
renewal,
unless
in
the
next
that
is
limitless
and
infinite.
for
a
transitory
enchanted
moment
man
must
have
held
his
breath
in
the
presence
of
this
continent,
compelled
into
an
aesthetic
contemplation
he
neither
understood
nor
desired,
face
to
face
for
the
last
time
in
history
with
something
commensurate
to
his
capacity
for
wonder.
i
tensed,
waiting
for
the
fury
-
both
his
and
mine
-
but
it
was
only
quiet
and
calm
in
the
darkness
of
his
room.
i
could
almost
taste
the
sweetness
of
reunion
in
the
air.
why
does
an
apple
fall
when
it
is
ripe?
is
it
brought
down
by
the
force
of
gravity?
is
it
because
its
stalk
withers?
because
it
is
dried
by
the
sun,
because
it
grows
too
heavy,
or
because
the
boy
standing
under
the
tree
wants
to
eat
it?
none
of
these
is
the
cause...
every
action
of
theirs,
that
seems
to
them
an
act
of
their
own
free
will,
is
in
the
historical
sense
not
free
at
all
but
is
bound
up
with
the
whole
course
of
history
and
preordained
from
all
eternity.
our
culture
has
become
hooked
on
the
quick-fix,
the
life
hack,
efficiency.
everyone
is
on
the
hunt
for
that
simple
action
algorithm
that
nets
maximum
profit
with
the
least
amount
of
effort.
there;s
no
denying
this
attitude
may
get
you
some
of
the
trappings
of
success,
if
you;re
lucky,
but
it
will
not
lead
to
a
calloused
mind
or
self-mastery.
if
you
want
to
master
the
mind
and
remove
your
governor,
you;ll
have
to
become
addicted
to
hard
work.
because
passion
and
obsession,
even
talent,
are
only
useful
tools
if
you
have
the
work
ethic
to
back
them
up.
last
of
all
came
the
cat,
who
looked
round,
as
usual,
for
the
warmest
place,
and
finally
squeezed
herself
in
between
boxer
and
clover;
there
she
purred
contentedly
throughout
major;s
speech
without
listening
to
a
word
of
what
he
was
saying.
woke
up,
fell
out
of

dragged
a
comb
across
my
head.
found
my
way
downstairs
and
drank
a

and
looking
up
i
noticed
i
was
late.
found
my
coat
and
grabbed
my
hat.
made
the

in
seconds
flat.
found
my

upstairs
and
had
a

and
somebody
spoke
and
i
went
into
a
dream.
poets
claim
that
we
recapture
for
a
moment
the
self
that
we
were
long
ago
when
we
enter
some
house
or
garden
in
which
we
used
to
live
in
our
youth.
but
these
are
most
hazardous
pilgrimages,
which
end
as
often
in
disappointment
as
in
success.
it
is
in
ourselves
that
we
should
rather
seek
to
find
those
fixed
places,
contemporaneous
with
different
years.
i
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
the
universe;
came
up
with
the
rules.
it
sets
a
bad
example
if
i
break
them
-
not
to
mention,
shows
favoritism.
why
should
one
person
get
a
miracle,
and
not
everybody
else?
can
you
imagine
the
confusion?
it;s
better
when
we
all
abide
by
the
rules.
let
folly
be
our
cloak,
a
veil
before
the
eyes
of
the
enemy!
for
he
is
very
wise,
and
weighs
all
things
to
a
nicety
in
the
scales
of
his
malice.
but
the
only
measure
that
he
knows
is
desire,
desire
for
power;
and
so
he
judges
all
hearts.
into
his
heart
the
thought
will
not
enter
that
any
will
refuse
it,
that
having
the
ring
we
may
seek
to
destroy
it.
if
we
seek
this,
we
shall
put
him
out
of
reckoning.
i
have
never
met
anyone
so
passionate
and
dedicated
to
a
belief
as
you.
it;s
so
intense
that
sometimes
it;s
blinding.
well,
you
see,
that;s
another
reason
i
can;t
help
you
catch
this
guy.
i
might
adversely
affect
the
fate
of
the
future.
i
mean
his
next
victim
might
be
the
mother
of
the
daughter
whose
son
invents
the
time
machine.
then
the
son
goes
back
in
time
and
changes
world
history
and
then
columbus
never
discovers
america,
man
never
lands
on
the
moon,
the
u.s.
never
invades
grenada.
or
something
less
significant
resulting
in
the
fact
that
my
father
never
meets
my
mother
and
consequently
i;m
never
born.
the
arts
are
not
a
way
to
make
a
living.
they
are
a
very
human
way
of
making
life
more
bearable.
practicing
an
art,
no
matter
how
well
or
badly,
is
a
way
to
make
your
soul

for
heaven;s

do
it
as
well

you
possibly
can.
you
will

you
will

i
don;t
know
what
the
world
may
need
but
a
v-8
engine;s
a
good
start
for
me.
i
think
i;ll
drive
and
find
a
place
to
be
surly.
i
don;t
know
what
the
world
may
want
but
some
words
of
wisdom
could
comfort
us.
think
i;ll
leave
that
up
to
someone
wiser.
a
great
part
of
its
theories
derives
an
additional
charm
from
the
peculiarity
that
important
propositions,
with
the
impress
of
simplicity
on
them,
are
often
easily
discovered
by
induction,
and
yet
are
of
so
profound
a
character
that
we
cannot
find
the
demonstrations
till
after
many
vain
attempts;
and
even
then,
when
we
do
succeed,
it
is
often
by
some
tedious
and
artificial
process,
while
the
simple
methods
may
long
remain
concealed.
still,
as
a
storyteller,
i;m
fascinated
how
a
person;s
sense
of
consciousness
can
be
so
transformed
by
nothing
more
magical
than
listening
to
words.
mere
words.
now!
this
is
it!
now
is
the
time
to

and

free

now

the

to

your
fate

being
comfortable
in
the
car
is
critical.
if
you;re
not

it
will
not
only
take
more
physical
energy
to
drive,
but
it
will
also
affect
you
mentally.
a
painful

will
reduce
your

you
don;t

your
whole

you

for
the

my
generation,
we
drink
because
it;s
good,
because
it
feels
better
than
unbuttoning
your
collar,
because
we
deserve
it.
we
drink
because
it;s
what

do.

those
were
her
exact
words.
yay,
you
found
one,
i
can
hear
her,
even
now.
wow,
you
found
another
one.
there
must
be
a
purpose
to
this.
that;s
it...
the
beacon
is

i

i
will

you.
together,

witness
mr.
henry
bemis,
a
charter
member
in
the
fraternity
of
dreamers.
a
bookish
little
man
whose
passion
is
the
printed
page,
but
who
is
conspired
against
by
a
bank
president
and
a
wife
and
a
world
full
of
tongue-cluckers
and
the
unrelenting
hands
of
a
clock.
but
in
just
a
moment,
mr.
bemis
will
enter
a
world
without
bank
presidents
or
wives
or
clocks
or
anything
else.
he;ll
have
a
world
all
to
himself,
without
anyone.
if
this
were
russia,
yeah
sure.
everyone
would
go
to
one
santa,
and
there
would
be
a
line
around
the
block
and
once
you
sat
on
her
lap
and
she;d
ask
you
what
you
wanted,
you
would
say
probably
"freedom."
at
which
point
the
kgb
would
arrest
you
and
send
you
to
siberia.
it;s
a
good
thing
russia
doesn;t
exist
anymore.
we
first
describe
a
collection
of
examples
of
simple
experiments
and
the
associated
sample
spaces
where
the
assumption
of
equally
likely
sample
points
seems
reasonable
and
then
calculate
probabilities
of
some
interesting
events.
these
experiments
are
simple
enough
that
we
can
just
list
the
sample
points
after
a
little
thinking.
i
don;t
hate
anybody.
the
winklevii
aren;t
suing
me
for
intellectual
property
theft.
they;re
suing
me
because
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
things
didn;t
go
exactly
the
way
they
were
supposed
to
for
them.
listen,
i
know
we;ve
had
our
problems
in
the
past,
but
we;ve
got
a
show
to
do
tonight.
pull
together
as
a
team.
life;s
too
short.
i
say
let;s
let
bygones
be
bygones.
if
you
took
the
raisins,
if
you
didn;t
take
the
raisins.
they
weren;t
even
my
raisins.
i
was
just
curious
because
it
seems
like
a
strange
thing
to
do,
to
walk
into
a
room,
audition,
and
walk
out
with
a
box
of
raisins.
anyway,
whatever.
if
you
ever
want
to
tell
me
about
it,
the
door
to
my
office
is
always
open.
in
the
event
that
i
get
an
office.
you;ll
come
in,
we;ll
talk
about
the
raisins,
have
a
nice
laugh.
she
gives
me
feelings
like
i
never
felt
before.
i;m
breaking
promises,
she;s
breaking
every
law.
she
used
to
look
good
to
me,
but
now
i
find
her
simply
irresistible.
evening
of
a
hot
day
started
the
little
wind
to
moving
among
the
leaves.
the
shade
climbed
up
the
hills
toward
the
top.
on
the
sand
banks
the
rabbits
sat
as
quietly
as
little
gray,
sculptured
stones.
we
live
in
a
strange
and
wonderful
universe.
its
age,
size,
violence,
and
beauty
require
extraordinary
imagination
to
appreciate.
the
place
we
humans
hold
within
this
vast
cosmos
can
seem
pretty
insignificant.
and
so
we
try
to
make
sense
of
it
all
and
to
see
how
we
fit
in.
out
of
my
thoughts!
you
are
part
of
my
existence,
part
of
myself.
you
have
been
in
every
line
i
have
ever
read,
since
i
first
came
here,
the
rough
common
boy
whose
poor
heart
you
wounded
even
then.
you
have
been
in
every
prospect
i
have
ever
seen
since
-
on
the
river,
on
the
sails
of
the
ships,
on
the
marshes,
in
the
clouds,
in
the
light,
in
the
darkness,
in
the
wind,
in
the
woods,
in
the
sea,
in
the
streets.
you
have
been
the
embodiment
of
every
graceful
fancy
that
my
mind
has
ever
become
acquainted
with.
i;ve
been
driving
this
route
for
15
years.
i;ve
brought
;em
out
here
to
get
that
stuff,
and
i;ve
drove
;em
home
after
they
had
it.
it
changes
them...
on
the
way
out
here,
they
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
ride.
they
talk
to
me;
sometimes
we
stop
and
watch
the
sunsets,
and
look
at
the
birds
flyin;.
sometimes
we
stop
and
watch
the
birds
when
there
ain;t
no
birds.
and
look
at
the
sunsets
when
it;s
raining.
we
have
a
swell
time.
and
i
always
get
a
big
tip.
you
know,
you;re
very
beautiful.
you;re
also
very
quiet.
and
i;m
not
used
to
girls
being
that
quiet
unless
they;re
medicated.
normally
i
go
out
with
girls
who
talk
so
much
you
could
hook
them
up
to
a
wind
turbine
and
they
could
power
a
small
new
hampshire
town.
keying
text
quickly
is
important,
but
it
is
more
important
to
be
able
to
make
it
look
professional.
making
the
text
readable
involves
positioning,
style,
and
size.
after
removal
from
the
oven,
the
pizza
is
sliced
and
plated
quickly
in
a
flat
cardboard
box,
which
is
immediately
closed
and
often
taped
shut.
there
is
no
physical
separation
after
the
slicing,
so
that
edge
can
be
ignored
and
we
can
treat
the
pizza,
for
thermal
purposes,
as
an
infinite
plane.
city
of
stars,
are
you
shining
just
for
me?
city
of
stars,
there;s
so
much
that
i
can;t
see.
who
knows?
is
this
the
start
of
something
wonderful
and
new?
or
one
more
dream
that
i
cannot
make
true?
harold,
everyone
has
the
right
to
make
an
ass
out
of
themselves.
you
just
can;t
let
the
world
judge
you
too
much.
all
animals
are
equal,
but
some
animals
are
more
equal
than
others.
when
we;re
fighting
i
can;t
find
the
right
words
to
say
but
i
know
it;ll
be
okay,
i
know
that
we;ll
be
okay
no
matter
what
i
say.
no
matter
what,
i;ll
stay
by
you.
will
you
stay
by
me?
our
lives
are
like
a
complex
musical
score.
filled
with
all
sorts
of
cryptic
writing,
sixteenth
and
thirty-second
notes
and
other
strange
signs.
it;s
next
to
impossible
to
correctly
interpret
these,
and
even
if
you
could,
and
could
then
transpose
them
into
the
correct
sounds,
there;s
no
guarantee
that
people
would
correctly
understand,
or
appreciate,
the
meaning
therein.
no
guarantee
it
would
make
people
happy.
why
must
the
workings
of
people;s
lives
be
so
convoluted?
it
is
so
discouraging
not
to
have
any
advice
and
companionship
about
my
work.
when
i
get
really
well,
john
says
we
will
ask
cousin
henry
and
julia
down
for
a
long
visit;
but
he
says
he
would
as
soon
put
fireworks
in
my
pillow-case
as
to
let
me
have
those
stimulating
people
about
now.
our
deepest
fear
is
not
that
we
are
inadequate.
our
deepest
fear
is
that
we
are
powerful
beyond
measure.
it
is
our
light,
not
our
darkness,
that
most
frightens
us.
we
ask
ourselves,
who
am
i
to
be
brilliant,
gorgeous,
talented
and
fabulous?
actually,
who
are
you
not
to
be?
you
are
a
child
of
god.
your
playing
small
doesn;t
serve
the
world.
we
were
born
to
make
manifest
the
glory
of
god
that
is
within
us.
it;s
not
just
in
some
of
us;
it;s
in
everyone.
and
as
we
let
our
own
light
shine,
we
unconsciously
give
other
people
permission
to
do
the
same.
as
we
are
liberated
from
our
own
fear,
our
presence
automatically
liberates
others.
as
we
become
aware
of
our
own
unavoidable
termination,
we
become
aware
of
the
fear-emotion.
and
i
think
that,
as
copulation
tends
towards
self-preservation,
all
fear
tends
towards
a
comprehension
of
the
final
ending.
in
fact,
the
mere
act
of
opening
the
box
will
determine
the
state
of
the
cat,
although
in
this
case
there
were
three
determinate
states
the
cat
could
be
in:
these
being
alive,
dead,
and
bloody
furious.
i
have
half
a
mind
to
make
you
hurt,
to
make
you
bleed,
to
make
you
suffer.
i
swear,
if
you;ve
touched
her
-
oh,
heaven,
forgive
what
i
would
do
to
you,
you
monster.
and
think
about
your
children?
they;ll
never
believe
what
you;ve
done.
there;s
a
diary.
here;s
the
last
page.
it;s
all
over.
the
fishmen
attack
if
i
make
even
the
slightest
noise.
i;d
rather
have
my
gums
scraped
than
have
to
fight
these
fiends.
let
me
get
this
straight.
you
think
that
your
client,
one
of
the
wealthiest,
most
powerful
men
in
the
world,
is
secretly
a
vigilante
who
spends
his
nights
beating
criminals
to
a
pulp
with
his
bare
hands?
and
your
plan
is
to
blackmail
this
person?
the
mind
which
is
created
quick
to
love,
is
responsive
to
everything
that
is
pleasing,
soon
as
by
pleasure
it
is
awakened
into
activity.
your
apprehensive
faculty
draws
an
impression
from
a
real
object,
and
unfolds
it
within
you,
so
that
it
makes
the
mind
turn
thereto.
and
if,
being
turned,
it
inclines
towards
it,
that
inclination
is
love;
that
is
nature,
which
through
pleasure
is
bound
anew
within
you.
the
wind
was
bitterly
cold.
the
snow
swirled,
blurring
his
vision.
but
somewhere
ahead,
through
the
blinding
storm,
he
knew
there
was
warmth
and
light.
using
his
final
strength,
and
a
special
knowledge
that
was
deep
inside
him,
jonas
found
the
sled
that
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
hill.
mr.
brady,
why
do
you
deny
the
one
faculty
of
man
that
raises
him
above
the
other
creatures
of
the
earth?
the
power
of
his
brain
to
reason.
what
other
merit
have
we?
the
elephant
is
larger;
the
horse
is
swifter
and
stronger;
the
butterfly
is
far
more
beautiful;
the
mosquito
is
more
prolific.
even
the
simple
sponge
is
more
durable.
but
does
a
sponge
think?
man
is
by
instinct
a
lover,
a
hunter,
a
fighter,
and
none
of
those
instincts
are
given
much
play
at
the
warehouse!
those
whom
i
could
persuade
to
talk
told
me
that
riddle
was
obsessed
with
his
parentage.
this
is
understandable,
of
course;
he
had
grown
up
in
an
orphanage
and
naturally
wished
to
know
how
he
came
to
be
there.
it
seems
that
he
searched
in
vain
for
some
trace
of
tom
riddle
senior
on
the
shields
in
the
trophy
room,
on
the
lists
of
prefects
in
the
old
school
records,
even
in
the
books
of
wizarding
history.
finally
he
was
forced
to
accept
that
his
father
had
never
set
foot
in
hogwarts.
do
you
wanna
come
with
me?
;cause
if
you
do
then
i
should
warn
you,
you;re
gonna
see
all
sorts
of
things.
ghosts
from
the
past.
aliens
from
the
future.
the
day
the
earth
died
in
a
ball
of
flame.
it
won;t
be
quiet,
it
won;t
be
safe,
and
it
won;t
be
calm.
but
i;ll
tell
you
what
it
will
be:
the
trip
of
a
lifetime.
would
you
like
to
ski
antarctica,
but
you;re
snowed
under
with
work?
do
you
dream
of
a
vacation
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
but
you
can;t
float
the
bill?
have
you
always
wanted
to
climb
the
mountains
of
mars,
but
now
you;re
over
the
hill?
then
come
to
rekall,
incorporated,
where
you
can
buy
the
memory
of
your
ideal
vacation,
cheaper,
safer,
and
better
than
the
real
thing.
so
don;t
let
life
pass
you
by.
call
rekall
for
the
memory
of
a
lifetime.
oh,
you
think
darkness
is
your
ally.
but
you
merely
adopted
the
dark;
i
was
born
in
it,
molded
by
it.
i
didn;t
see
the
light
until
i
was
already
a
man,
by
then
it
was
nothing
to
me
but
blinding!
and
aunt
zelda
all
the
women
looked
like
you
and
uncle
bob
all
the
cows
looked
like
you
and
ernie
there
were
cavemen
that
looked
like
you
and
there
were
all
these
nerdy
little
kids
like
you
billy
and
there
were
monsters
and
stupid-looking
things
and
animals
could
talk
and
some
of
it
was
confusing
and...
and...
and...
oh,
wow!
there;s
no
place
like
home!
i;m
rick
harrison,
and
this
is
my
pawn
shop.
i
work
here
with
my
old
man
and
my
son,
big
hoss.
everything
in
here
has
a
story
and
a
price.
one
thing
i;ve
learned
after
21
years
-
you
never
know
what
is
gonna
come
through
that
door.
if
the
moon,
in
the
act
of
completing
its
eternal
way
around
the
earth,
were
gifted
with
self-consciousness,
it
would
feel
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
was
traveling
its
way
of
its
own
accord...
so
would
a
being,
endowed
with
higher
insight
and
more
perfect
intelligence,
watching
man
and
his
doings,
smile
about
man;s
illusion
that
he
was
acting
according
to
his
own
free
will.
i;m
not
part
of
this
little
project
now,
which
gives
me
a
clarity
i
didn;t
have
before.
annie,
george,
mitchell,
nina,
the
two
of
you,
what
none
of
you
realized
-
what
none
of
us
realized
-
is
the
desire
to
be
human
is
the
end,
not
the
beginning.
to
want
it
is
to
have
it.
you;re
not
wasting
your
time,
tom.
you;ve
already
won.
the
number
nine
is
not
ten.
the
number
eleven
is
not
ten.
although
the
two
numbers
are
almost
ten,
they
can
never
be
ten.
they
are
untenable.
you
can
add
one
to
nine
to
make
it
ten,
but
it
would
no
longer
be
nine!
it
would
be
ten!
same
with
eleven!
when
nine
is
nine
and
eleven
is
eleven,
they
are
untenable!
their
possessions
are
untenable!
they
have
to
go.
smell
is
the
most
powerful
trigger
to
the
memory
there
is.
a
certain
flower
or
a
whiff
of
smoke
can
bring
up
experiences
long
forgotten.
books
smell
musty
and
rich.
the
knowledge
gained
from
a
computer
is...
it
has
no
texture,
no
context.
it;s
there
and
then
it;s
gone.
if
it;s
to
last,
then
the
getting
of
knowledge
should
be
tangible.
it
should
be,
um,
smelly.
fool,
prate
not
to
me
about
covenants.
there
can
be
no
covenants
between
men
and
lions,
wolves
and
lambs
can
never
be
of
one
mind,
but
hate
each
other
out
and
out
and
through.
therefore
there
can
be
no
understanding
between
you
and
me,
nor
may
there
be
any
covenants
between
us,
till
one
or
other
shall
fall.
every
man
desires
to
live
long,
but
no
man
wishes
to
be
old.
till
then,
my
noble
friend,
chew
upon
this:
brutus
had
rather
be
a
villager
than
to
repute
himself
a
son
of
rome
under
these
hard
conditions
as
this
time
is
like
to
lay
upon
us.
after
all,
what
justification
is
there
for
a
word
which
is
simply
the
opposite
of
some
other
word?
you
know,
michael;
now
that
you;re
so
respectable,
i
think
you;re
more
dangerous
than
ever.
i
liked
you
better
when
you
were
just
a
common
mafia
hood.
it;s
something
turians
are
taught
from
birth.
if
even
one
person
is
still
left
standing
at
the
end
of
a
war,
then
the
fight
was
worth
it.
on
the
eve
of
a
day
that;s
forgotten
and
fake
and
the
trees
they
await
and
clouds
anticipate
the
start
of
a
day
when
we
put
on
our
face
a
mask
that
portrays
that
we
don;t
need
grace.
on
the
eve
of
a
day
that
is
bigger
than
us
but
we
open
our
eyes
because
we;re
told
that
we
must
and
the
trees
wave
their
arms
and
the
clouds
try
to
plead,
desperately
yelling
there;s
something
we
need.
i;m
not
free,
i
asked
forgiveness
three
times,
same
amount
that
i
denied;
i
three-time
mvped
this
crime.
i;m
afraid
to
tell
you
who
i
adore,
won;t
tell
you
who
i;m
singing
towards.
the
more
things
change,
the
more
they
stay
the
same.
i;m
not
sure
who
the
first
person
was
who
said
that.
probably
shakespeare.
or
maybe
sting.
but
at
the
moment,
it;s
the
sentence
that
best
explains
my
tragic
flaw:
my
inability
to
change.
i
don;t
think
i;m
alone
in
this.
the
more
i
get
to
know
other
people,
the
more
i
realize
it;s
kind
of
everyone;s
flaw.
staying
exactly
the
same
for
as
long
as
possible,
standing
perfectly
still...
it
feels
safer
somehow.
if
you
can;t
focus
at
all,
it;s
also
good
to
confine
yourself
somewhere
and
study!
the
thrill
of
studying
in
a
place
where
you
might
get
caught
does
wonders
for
your
focus!
oh,
and
i
also
recommend
studying
in
a
disaster
zone.
the
thrill
of
studying
in
a
place
where
you
could
actually
die
does
wonders
for
your
focus!
oh,
and
i
also
recommend
studying
in
the
middle
of
your
exams.
the
thrill
of
knowing
it;s
too
late
to
get
any
studying
done
does
wonders
for
your
focus!
jill,
this
is
sergeant
sacker.
listen
to
me.
we;ve
traced
the
call...
it;s
coming
from
inside
the
house.
now
a
squad
car;s
coming
over
there
right
now,
just
get
out
of
that
house!
it;s
an
odd
feeling,
farewell.
there
is
such
envy
in
it.
men
go
off
to
be
tested
for
courage.
if
we;re
tested
at
all,
it;s
for
patience,
for
doing
without,
for
how
well
we
can
endure
loneliness.
to
be
honest,
as
this
world
goes,
is
to
be
one
man
picked
out
of
ten
thousand.
there
are
two
kinds
of
fibers
in
our
muscles,
red
and
white.
when
an
athlete
trains
for
long
distance
running,
he
or
she
builds
more
red
muscle
fibers
than
white
muscle
fibers
in
his
calf
muscles.
a
sprinter
has
more
white
muscles.
if
you
retrain
a
marathon
runner
to
be
a
sprinter,
most
of
the
muscle
fibers
will
convert
to
white
muscles.
we;ve
learned
that
the
balance
of
nutrients
in
cow;s
milk
doesn;t
meet
the
needs
of
human
infants,
that
most
adult
humans
on
the
planet
can;t
digest
the
milk
sugar
called
lactose,
that
the
best
route
to
calcium
balance
may
not
be
massive
milk
intake.
these
complications
help
remind
us
that
milk
was
designed
to
be
a
food
for
the
young
and
rapidly
growing
calf,
not
for
the
young
or
mature
human.
what
she
done
was
wrong
and
she
gotta
be
punished.
for
the
next
two
weeks,
no
out
after
school.
no
out
at
all.
if
you
find
yourself
having
fun
at
something,
stop
it.
and
no
delicious
foods
for
three
weeks.
you
only
gotta
eat
the
terrible
foods
that
are
good
for
you.
and
then
no
tv
for
a
week.
and
the
next
week,
and
this
is
gonna
be
tougher:
educational
tv
only.
this
is
our
world
now.
the
world
of
the
electron
and
the
switch;
the
beauty
of
the
baud.
we
exist
without
nationality,
skin
color,
or
religious
bias.
you
wage
wars,
murder,
cheat,
lie
to
us
and
try
to
make
us
believe
it;s
for
our
own
good,
yet
we;re
the
criminals.
yes,
i
am
a
criminal.
my
crime
is
that
of
curiosity.
i
am
a
hacker,
and
this
is
my
manifesto.
you
may
stop
me,
but
you
can;t
stop
us
all.
i
have
been
improving
the
wrong
way,
like
bad
fish
in
warm
weather.
one
day
last
week,
i
had
a
woeful
day
of
headache,
nausea,
and
malaise,
which
left
me
weak
as
a
sea
anemone
at
low
water.
since
then,
there
has
been
no
improvement.
the
ingenious
are
always
fanciful,
and
the
truly
imaginative
never
otherwise
than
analytic.
what
should
have
been
swift
revenge
turned
into
an
all
out
war.
the
city
of
god
was
divided.
you
couldn;t
go
from
one
section
to
the
other,
not
even
to
visit
a
relative.
the
cops
considered
anyone
living
in
the
slum
a
hoodlum.
people
got
used
to
living
in
vietnam,
and
more
and
more
volunteers
signed
up
to
die.
our
job
is
to
find
truth,
no
matter
how
painful
it
may
be.
the
man
who
reviews
his
own
life,
as
i
do
mine,
in
going
on
here,
from
page
to
page,
had
need
to
have
been
a
good
man
indeed,
if
he
would
be
spared
the
sharp
consciousness
of
many
talents
neglected,
many
opportunities
wasted,
many
erratic
and
perverted
feelings
constantly
at
war
within
his
breast,
and
defeating
him.
i
know
that
the
idea
of
raising
well-rounded,
smarter
kids
can
be
daunting.
and
sadly,
no
easy
formula
exists.
kids
are
as
complex,
varied,
and
exciting
individuals
as
you
are.
the
good
news
is
that
your
child
has
a
natural
desire
to
do
well.
your
job
as
parent
is
to
bring
out
this
quality
and
cherish
it
until
the
day
your
kids
leave
home,
and
then
some.
as
i;ve
gotten
older,
i
realize
i;m
certain
of
only
two
things.
days
that
begin
with
rowing
on
a
lake
are
better
than
days
that
do
not.
second,
a
man;s
character
is
his
fate.
and
as
a
student
of
history,
i
find
this
hard
to
refute.
for
most
of
us
our
stories
can
be
written
long
before
we
die.
there
are
exceptions
among
the
great
men
of
history,
but
they
are
rare,
and
i
am
not
one
of
them.
i
am
a
teacher
-
simply
that.
i
taught
for
34
years.
one
day
i
stopped
teaching.
those
were
the
facts
of
my
life;s
chronicle.
the
last
chapter
had
been
written.
my
book
was
closed.
the
goal
of
the
true
seeker
is
to
become
a
sage,
or
superior
man.
there
are
certain
immutable
laws
of
the
universe,
which
the
sage
must
be
in
harmony
with.
different
ninja
sects
espouse
some
laws
in
particular,
according
them
greater
significance
than
the
others.
but
each
law
is
essential
in
its
own
right,
and
must
be
considered
equal
to
the
rest.
i
can
show
you
the
world
-
shining,
shimmering,
splendid.
tell
me,
princess,
now
when
did
you
last
let
your
heart
decide?
i
can
open
your
eyes,
take
you
wonder
by
wonder.
over,
sideways,
and
under
on
a
magic
carpet
ride.
a
whole
new
world,
a
new
fantastic
point
of
view.
no
one
to
tell
us
no,
or
where
to
go,
or
say
we;re
only
dreaming.
a
whole
new
world,
a
dazzling
place
i
never
knew.
but
when
i;m
way
up
here,
it;s
crystal
clear
that
now
i;m
in
a
whole
new
world
with
you.
once
he
was
as
great
as
his
fame
made
him.
his
knowledge
was
deep,
his
thought
was
subtle,
and
his
hands
marvelously
skilled;
and
he
had
a
power
over
the
minds
of
others.
the
wise
he
could
persuade,
and
the
smaller
folk
he
could
daunt.
that
power
he
certainly
still
keeps.
there
are
not
many
in
middle-earth

defeat.

if
you
fantasize
about
your

-
i

i;ve

there;s

than
who;d

we
are

will
be
a
chorus,
an
overwhelming
sound.

i

you
lately
that
i
love
you?
have
i
told
you
there;s
no
one
above

fill
my
heart
with
gladness,
take
away
all
my
sadness,
ease
my
troubles,
that;s
what
you
do.
luke,
you;re
going
to
find
that
many
of
the
truths
we
cling
to
depend
greatly
on
our
own
point
of
view.
anakin
was
a
good
friend.
when
i
first
met
him,
your
father
was
already
a
great
pilot.
but
i
was
amazed
how
strongly
the
force
was
with
him.
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
train
him
as
a
jedi.
i
thought
that
i
could
instruct
him
just
as
well
as
yoda.
i
was
wrong.
you
know,
it;s
funny
what
a
young
man
recollects.
;cause
i
don;t
remember
being
born
if
you
know
what
i
mean.
i
don;t
recall
what
i
got
for
my
first
christmas
and
i
don;t
know
when
i
went
on
my
first
outdoor
picnic.
but
i
do
remember
the
first
time
i
heard
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
wide
world.
waving
colored
flags,
we
won;t
surrender,
there;s
no
standing
down.
love;s
a
playing
field,

we;re
breaking
new
ground.
i
had
a
dream
last
night,
and
another
oracle
spoke
to
me.
its
voice
was
heavenly...
"if
you
keep
going
around
and
around
the
red
palm
tree
in
the
distant
desert
town
dry
dry
outpost
something
good
will
happen."
so
said
the
voice
in
my
dream.
it
doesn;t
seem
to
make
any
sense
at
all
to
me.
in
fact,
thinking
about
it
makes
me
so
uneasy
that
i
can;t
sleep
at
night.
if
you
find
out
what
it
means,
please
tell
me.
there;s
something
happening
somewhere.
baby,
i
just
know
that
there
is.
i
know
i;m
asking
a
lot.
the
price
of
freedom
is
high,
always
has
been.
it;s
a
price
i;m
willing
to
pay.
if
i;m
the
only
one,
then
so
be
it,
but
i;m
willing
to
bet
i;m
not.
if
one
person
casts
a
stone
at
us,
cast
stones
back
with
two
people!
if
two
people
cast
stones,
cast
stones
back
with
four!
if
eight
do,
with
sixteen!
if
a
thousand
do,
stand
up
and
fight
with
the
entire
village!
consider
an
insult
to
one
an
insult
to
everyone!
a
setup
like
that
cost
more
than
we
ever
took.
that
crazy
harriman.
that;s
bad
business!
how
long
do
you
think
i;d
stay
in
operation
if
every
time
i
pulled
a
job
it
cost
me
money?
if
he;d
just
pay
me
what
he;s
spending
to
make
me
stop
robbing
him,
i;d
stop
robbing
him!
what
i
want
you
to
be
-
i
don;t
mean
physically
but
morally,
you
are
very
well
physically
-
is
a
firm
fellow,
a
fine
firm
fellow,
with
a
will
of
your
own,
with
resolution.
with
determination.
with
strength
of
character
that
is
not
to
be
influenced
except
on
good
reason
by
anybody,
or
by
anything.
that;s
what
i
want
you
to
be.
that;s
what
your
father
and
your
mother
might
both
have
been.
i
don;t
want
the
money,
i
want
something
more.
and
i;ve
never
said
that
out
loud
but
i
can;t
pretend
that;s
not
true
anymore.
by
the
time
i
was
ten,
playing
baseball
got
to
be
like
eating
vegetables
or
taking
out
the
garbage.
so
when
i
was
fourteen,
i
started
to
refuse.
could
you
believe
that?

it
never

and
may
it
never
change

the
universe
divided
as
the
heart
and
mind
collided
with
the
people
left
unguided
for
so
many
troubled
years.
in
a
cloud
of
doubts
and
fears,
their
world
was
torn
asunder
into
hollow
hemispheres.
some
fought
themselves,
some
fought
each
other.
most
just
followed
one
another,
lost,
aimless,
like
their
brothers.
for
their
hearts
were
so
unclear
and
the
truth
could
not
appear.
their
spirits
were
divided
into
blinded
hemispheres.
what,
then,
is
that
incalculable
feeling
that
deprives
the
mind
of
the
sleep
necessary
to
life?
a
world
that
can
be
explained
even
with
bad
reasons
is
a
familiar
world.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
in
a
universe
suddenly
divested
of
illusions
and
lights,
man
feels
an
alien,
a
stranger.
his
exile
is
without
remedy
since
he
is
deprived
of
the
memory
of
a
lost
home
or
the
hope
of
a
promised
land.
this
divorce
between
man
and
his
life,
the
actor
and
his
setting,
is
properly
the
feeling
of
absurdity.

in
the

the
story
of
the

will
be
twisted
and
bent;
hammered
like
soft
metal.
by
some
accounts,
a
monster

had
to
be
put
down.
by
others,
a
victim
of

because
in
the

you
found
another

you;ll
always
remember
the
truth,
won;t
you?
your
truth,
at

hello,
babies.
welcome
to
earth.
it;s
hot
in
the
summer
and
cold
in
the
winter.
it;s
round
and
wet
and
crowded.
at
the
outside,
babies,
you;ve
got
about
a
hundred
years
here.
i
went
to
a
party
at
the
local
county
jail;
all
the
cons
were
dancing,
and
the
band
began
to
wail.
but
the
guys
were
indiscreet;
they
were
brawling
in
the
street.
at
the
local
dance;
at
the
local
county
jail.
i
feel
sorry
for
you.
what
it
must
feel
like
to
want
to
pull
the
switch!
ever
since
you
walked
into
this
room,
you;ve
been
acting
like
a
self-appointed
public
avenger.
you
want
to
see
this
boy
die
because
you
personally
want
it,
not
because
of
the
facts!
you;re
a
sadist!
as
for
you,
my
galvanized
friend,
you
want
a
heart.
you
don;t
know
how
lucky
you
are
not
to
have
one.
hearts
will
never
be
practical
until
they
can
be
made
unbreakable.
deep
into
that
darkness
peering,
long
i
stood
there
wondering,
fearing,
doubting,
dreaming
dreams
no
mortal
ever
dared
to
dream
before.
one
overarching
lesson
we
have
learned
during
the
past
hundred
years
is
that
the
known
laws
of
physics
are
associated
with
principles
of
symmetry.
don;t
worry.
as
long
as
you
hit
that
wire
with
the
connecting
hook
at
precisely
88
miles
per
hour
the
instant
the
lightning
strikes
the
tower,
everything
will
be
fine.

plan
to
leave.
you

me

well,
an
element
of
conflict
in
any
discussion;s
a
very
good
thing.
it
means
everybody
is
taking
part
and
nobody
is
left
out.
i
wasn;t
like
every
other
kid,
you
know,
who
dreams
about
being
an
astronaut.
i
was
always
more
interested
in
what
bark
was
made
out
of
on
a
tree.

would
be
another
person
who;s
a

the
music
that
he;s
created
over
the
years,
i
don;t
really
listen
to
it,
but
the
fact
that
he;s
making
it,
i
respect
that.
i
care
desperately
about
what
i
do.
do
i
know
what
product
i;m
selling?
no.
do
i
know
what
i;m
doing
today?
no.
but
i;m
here,
and
i;m
gonna
give
it
my
best
shot.
i
consider
myself
to
be
a
man
of
principle.
but,
what
man
does
not?
even
the
cutthroat,
i
have
noticed,
considers
his
actions
"moral"
after
a
fashion.
perhaps
another
person,
reading
of
my
life,
would
name
me
a
religious
tyrant.
he
could
call
me
arrogant.
what
is
to
make
that
man;s
opinion
any
less
valid
than
my
own?
i
guess
it
all
comes
down
to
one
fact:
in
the
end,
i;m
the
one
with
the
armies.
the
noise
was
terrible.
every
time
a
mortar
went
off,
i
jumped.
i
couldn;t
help
myself.
the
noise
went
into
you.
it
touched
parts
of
you
that
were
small
and
frightened
and
wanting
your
mommy.
unlike
the
other
four
senses
located
in
the
logical
regions
of
the
forebrain,
our
sense
of
smell
is
wired
directly
into
the
limbic
system,
the
so-called
"reptilian"
cellar
of
the
brain
responsible
for
our
most
basic
emotions,
from
rage
to
lust.
when
i
was
a
prisoner
in
pretoria
they
used
to
keep
us
awake
at
night
with
fireworks
after
news
such
as
that
of
colenso
and
magersfontein,
but,
except
amongst
the
young
boys,
they
were
not
given
to
exultation
over
what
they
had
done
or
to
any
boasting.
then
they
talked
about
lyddite,
and
it
was
quite
clear
that
it
had
been
a
terrible
bogy
in
their
minds,
and
that
they
had
imagined
it
was
to
have
an
effect
like
throwing
earthquakes
at
them,
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
the
result
of
actual
experience
had
fallen
short
of
their
apprehensions.
i
been
slumping
all
season
but
now
i
found
a
reason.
i
struck
on
a
love
that
is
true.
i
used
to
play
the
field,
i
used
to
be
a
roamer,
but
the
season;s
turning
;round
for
me
now.
i
finally
bagged
me
a
homer.
that;s
right,
i
finally
bagged
me
a
homer.
i;ve
always
felt
there;s
something
inherently
psychopathic
about
joining
the
army
in
peacetime.
as
far
as
i;m
concerned
people
join
the
army
to
find
out
what
it;s
like
to
kill
someone.
i
hardly
think
that;s
an
inclination
that
should
be
encouraged
in
modern
society,
do
you?
i
never
had
no
trouble
with
these
people.
i
sat
in
this
window.
i
watched
these
little
kids
get
old.
and
i
seen
the
old
people
get
older.
yeah,
sure,
some
of
them
don;t
like
us,
but
most
of
them
do.
i
mean,
for
christ;s
sake,
pino,
they
grew
up
on
my
food.
on
my
food.
and
i;m
very
proud
of
that.
resistance
is
usually
ascribed
to
bodies
at
rest,
and
impulse
to
those
in
motion;
but
motion
and
rest,
as
commonly
conceived,
are
only
relatively
distinguished;
nor
are
those
bodies
always
truly
at
rest,
which
commonly
are
taken
to
be
so.
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
people
to
dissolve
the
political
bands
which
have
connected
them
with
another
and
to
assume
among
the
powers
of
the
earth,
the
separate
and
equal
station
to
which
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nature;s
god
entitle
them,
a
decent
respect
to
the
opinions
of
mankind
requires
that
they
should
declare
the
causes
which
impel
them
to
the
separation.
you
think
there;s
something
feminine
about
it?
my
father
was
the
tallest,
handsomest,
vainest
man
in
new
york,
and
he
got
his
nails
done.
he
had
his
fourth
coronary
behind
the
wheel
and
hit
a
tree.
the
windshield
severed
his
arm,
and
he
was
dead,
so
they
never
put
it
back
on.
in
the
casket
he
had
one
hand.
the
nails
were
perfect.

do
you
know
how
many
we
would
have
to
kill
to

-
yes.

take
us
seven

what
do
you
say,
guys?
you
can
just
hang
outside
in
the
sun
all

tossing
a
ball
around...
or
you
can
sit
at

and
do
something
that
matters.
we
think
voldemort
wants
to
build
up
his
army,
not
just
witches
and
wizards,
but
all
manner
of
dark
creatures.
he;s
been
recruiting
heavily,
and
we;re
attempting
to
do
the
same.
the
pied
piper,
he
thought.
he
and
katherine
had
a
book
of
fairy
tales
when
they
were
little.
she
had
loved
it,
but
he
had
hated
it,
because
of
one
illustration
that
frightened
him:
the
one
of
the
pied
piper
leading
the
children
of
hamelin
to
their
doom.
in
the
picture
the
children
were
skipping
and
laughing
and
dancing
to
the
piper;s
tune,
but
jonah
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
to
them.
he
couldn;t
stand
for
them
to
be
so
happy
when
they
ought
to
be
scared.
my
cousin
anthony
went
into
business
for
himself
-
we
all
know
this
-
in
a
way
for
which
there
is
no
excuse.
he;s
got
a
problem
with
rage.
he
disappointed
me,
anthony,
in
ways
that
i
can;t
even
begin
to
tell
you,
and
he
put
us
all
at
risk.
irregardless,
it;s
been
made
clear
to
me
that
if
they
put
their
hands
on
him,
he
will
not
be
dealt
with
quick.
we;re
talking
torture.
for
that
reason,
even
if
i
knew
where
my
cousin
was,
and
i
do
not,
i
would
not
deliver
him
up
to
them.
i
am
offering
him
the
same
protection
that
i
would
offer
any
of
you
in
similar
circumstances.
john-boy,
lemme
tell
you
something.
you
know,
them
chains
ain;t
medals.
you
get
;em
for
making
mistakes.
and
you
make
a
bad
enough
mistake,
and
then
you
gotta
deal
with
the
man.
and
he
is
one
rough
old
boy.
i
was
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
vague
discontent
and
dissatisfaction
with
my
own
life,
which
was
passing
so
quickly
and
uninterestingly,
and
i
kept
thinking
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
i
could
tear
my
heart
out
of
my
breast,
that
heart
which
had
grown
so
weary
of
life.
this
is
the
end,
beautiful
friend.
this
is
the
end,
my
only
friend
-
the
end
of
our
elaborate
plans,
the
end
of
everything
that
stands,
the
end.
no
safety
or
surprise,
the
end.
i;ll
never
look
into
your
eyes,
again.
i;m
not
in
existential
crisis!
just
the
opposite.
i
was
fine
when
existence
had
no
meaning.
meaninglessness
in
a
universe
that
has
no
meaning
-
that
i
get.
but
meaninglessness
in
a
universe
that
has
meaning...
what
does
it
mean?
everything
that
lives
is
designed
to
end.
we
are
perpetually
trapped
in
a
never
ending
spiral
of
life
and
death.
is
this
a
curse?
or
some
kind
of
punishment?
excessive
intake
of
alcohol
as
we
know
kills
brain
cells.
but
naturally,
it
attacks
the
slowest
and
weakest
brain
cells
first.
in
this
way,
regular
consumption
of
beer
eliminates
the
weaker
brain
cells,
making
the
brain
a
faster
and
more
efficient
machine.
that;s
why
you
always
feel
smarter
after
a
few
beers.
there
is
a
vast
melancholy
in
the
canticles
of
the
wolves,
melancholy
infinite
as
the
forest,
endless
as
these
long
nights
of
winter
and
yet
that
ghastly
sadness,
that
mourning
for
their
own,
irremediable
appetites,

it;s
like

like
a

like
a

like
a
gas-hinge

the

admit

didn;t

heroic
to
me.
i
do
not

any

to
know
i
have
done
the
right

i
got
the
feeling
poseidon
really
didn;t
know
what
to
think
of
me.
he
didn;t
know
whether
he
was
happy
to
have
me
as
a
son
or
not.
in
a
strange
way,
i
was
glad
that
poseidon
was
so
distant.
if
he;d
tried
to
apologize,
or
told
me
he
loved
me,
or
even
smiled,
it
would;ve
felt
fake.
lasher,
paul
realized,

unshocked
by
the

undisturbed
by

even,
inexplicably,
at

paul,
perhaps,
had
been
the
one
most
out
of
touch,
having
had
little
time
for
reflection,
having
been
so
eager
to
join
a

confident
organization

seeming
answers
to

that

made
him
sorry

many

of
losing
their

you
know,
i
got
to
be
honest
with
you,

i;m
not
thrilled
about
the
way
you
handled
it.
and,
uh,
i
could
take
it
up
with
the
school
committee,
or
i
could
take
it
up
with
the
principal.
i
could
do
a
lot
of
things,
but
what
i;m
going
to
do
is
pull
on
your
bowtie,
and
untie
it,
right
in

of

embarrass
you.
you
sit
around

you

you

the

it

we;re

the

things
that

fierce
conviction.
ingratitude
is
amongst
them
a
capital
crime,
as
we
read
it
to
have
been
in
some
other
countries:
for
they
reason
thus;
that
whoever
makes
ill-returns
to
his
benefactor,
must
needs
be
a
common
enemy
to
the
rest
of
the
mankind,
from
where
he
has
received
no
obligations
and
therefore
such
man
is
not
fit
to
live.

say
life
is

now
we
find
ourselves
somewhere
inside

and
in
the
process
of
walking
out
of
it,
suddenly
we
realize
our
time
in
here
is
fleeting.
is
our
quick
experience
here
pointless?
does
anything
we

do

we

oh,
and
when
you
held
my
hand,
i
knew
that
it
was
now
or

those
were
the
best
days
of
my
life.
i
was
on
a
ski
weekend,
up
at
stowe.
i
was
coming
in
late
one
day,
last
person
off
the
slope.
the
sun
had
just
gone
down.
and
the
sky
became
this
incredible
color.
i
usually
don;t
notice
things
like
that,
and
i
found
myself
kind
of
walking
around
in
the
cold,
hoping
that
it
wouldn;t
change,
wishing
that
i
had
somebody
there
to
share
it
with
me.
and
afterwards
i
tried
to
convince
myself
that
i;d
imagined
that
color,
that
i
hadn;t
really
seen
it,
that
nothing
on
this
earth
could
be
that
beautiful.
now
i
see
i
was
wrong.
to
carry
the
art,
however,
to
its
highest
pitch,
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilize
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
knowledge,
and
this
in
itself
implies,
as
you
will
readily
see,
a
possession
of
all
knowledge,
which,
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
encyclopedias,
is
a
somewhat
rare
accomplishment.
it
is
not
so
impossible,
however,
that
a
man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
work,
and
this
i
have
endeavored
in
my
case
to
do.
mr.
sandman,
bring
me
a
dream,
make
him
the
cutest
that
i;ve
ever
seen.
give
him
two
lips,
like
roses
and
clover,
then
tell
him
that
his
lonesome
nights
are
over!
sandman,
i;m
so
alone,
don;t
have
nobody
to
call
my
own.
please
turn
on
your
magic

relativity
is
relatively
easy
to
understand.
but
there;s
one
aspect
of
relativity
that
consistently
trips
us
up.
it;s
this:
we
not
only
tend
to
compare
things
with
one
another
but
also
tend
to
focus
on
comparing
things
that
are
easily
comparable,
and
avoid
comparing
things
that
cannot
be
compared
easily.

vanity

are
different
things,
though
the
words
are
often
used
synonymously.
a
person
may
be
proud

pride
relates
more
to

vanity

every
artist
is
a
man
who
has
freed
himself
from
his
family,
his
nation,
his
race.
every
man
who
has
shown
the
world
the
way
to
beauty,
to
true
culture,
has
been
a
rebel,
a
;universal;
without
patriotism,
without
home,
who
has
found
his
people
everywhere.
if
you;ve
ever
studied
touch-typing
on
the
qwerty
keyboard,
you
probably
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
getting
comfortable
with
the
home
position
and
with
the
proper
ways
to
stretch
your
fingers
to
reach
all
the
keys.
on
a
steno
keyboard,
none
of
that
complexity
exists,
and
you
can
learn
proper
fingering
in
about
one
minute.

can;t
understand
everything
at
once,
we
can;t
begin
with
perfection
all
at

in
order
to
reach
perfection
one
must
begin
by
being
ignorant
of
a
great
deal.
and
if
we
understand
things
too
quickly,
perhaps
we
shan;t
understand
them
thoroughly.

we

determine

is
perhaps

we
sometimes
encounter
people,
even
perfect
strangers,
who
begin
to
interest
us
at
first
sight,
somehow
suddenly,
all
at
once,
before
a
word
has
been
spoken.
i
have
been
taking
care
of
it!
i
already
got

to
cut
me

i
got
my
friend
pete
to
make
the
boots,
but
only
because
i
promised
him
a
new
set
of
teeth.
and
as
you
probably
know,

that;s

lie
here
on

great
immovable

nailed

-

pattern

by
the
hour.

is
as
good
as

i
assure
you.
i
start,
we;ll
say,
at
the
bottom,
down
in
the
corner
over
there
where
it
has
not
been
touched,
and
i
determine
for
the
thousandth
time
that
i
will
follow
that
pointless
pattern
to
some
sort
of
a
conclusion.
ever
since
the
dawn
of
civilization,
people
have
not
been
content
to
see
events
as
unconnected
and
inexplicable.
they
have
craved
an
understanding
of
the
underlying
order
in
the
world.
today
we
still
yearn
to
know
why
we
are
here
and
where
we
came
from.
humanity;s
deepest
desire
for
knowledge
is
justification
enough
for
our
continuing
quest.
and
our
goal
is
nothing
less
than
a
complete
description
of
the
universe
we
live
in.
the
right
man
in
the
wrong
place
can
make
all
the
difference
in
the

wake
up,
mister

up
and...

we
have
faced
our
enemies

we
did

were

at
his
death
left
not

a

also
a
not

i
just
don;t
see
what
purpose
is
it
going
to
serve
your
going?
i
mean,
you
think
dead
people
care
who;s
at
the
funeral?
they
don;t
even
know
they;re
having
a
funeral.
it;s
not

all
programs
have
to
manage
the
way
they
use
a
computer;s
memory
while
running.
some
languages
have
garbage
collection
that
constantly
looks
for
no
longer
used
memory
as
the
program
runs;
in
other
languages,
the
programmer
must
explicitly
allocate
and
free
the
memory.
rust
uses
a
third
approach:
memory
is
managed
through
a
system
of
ownership
with
a
set
of
rules
that
the
compiler
checks
at
compile
time.
none
of
the
ownership
features
slow
down

program

it;s
running.

once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
magnificent
race
of
animals
that
dominated
the
world
through
age
after
age.
they
ran,
they
swam,
and
they
fought
and
they
flew,
until
suddenly,
quite
recently,
they
disappeared.
nature
just
gave
up
and
started
again.
we
weren;t
even
apes
then.
we
were
just
these
smart
little
rodents

in
the

will
start
over.

i
can

who
is
evil?
who
is
righteous?
these
terms
have
changed
throughout
history.
kids
who
have
never
seen
peace
and
kids
who
have
never
seen
war
have
different
values.
those
who
stand
at
the
top
determine
what;s

what;s
right,
this

place
is

will
prevail,

say?

it
will.

wins

between
me
and
the
other
world
there
is
ever
an
unasked
question:
unasked
by
some
through
feelings
of
delicacy;
by
others
through
the
difficulty
of
rightly
framing
it.
how
does
it
feel
to
be
a
problem?
there
is
no
escape.
don;t
make
me

you

join
me,
and
i
will
complete
your
training.
with
our
combined
strength,
we
can
end
this
destructive
conflict
and
bring
order
to
the
galaxy.
i
believe
like
a
child
that
suffering
will
be
healed
and
made
up
for,
that
all
the
humiliating
absurdity
of
human
contradictions
will
vanish
like
a
pitiful
mirage,
like
the
despicable
fabrication
of
the
impotent
and
infinitely
small
euclidean
mind
of
man,
that
in
the
world;s
finale,
at
the
moment
of
eternal
harmony,
something
so
precious
will
come
to
pass
that
it
will
suffice
for
all
hearts,
for
the
comforting
of
all
resentments,
for
the
atonement
of
all
the
crimes
of
humanity,
for
all
the
blood
that
they;ve
shed;
that
it
will
make
it
not
only
possible
to
forgive
but
to
justify
all
that
has
happened.

finding
a
way
into
a
criminal
organization
is
about
observing
social
dynamics.
you
start
with
a
target.
you;re
looking
for
just
the
right
person
to
approach.
people
in
the
inner
circle
are
usually
too
tough
to
go
after
-
anyone
with
real
power
is
bound
to
be
cautious.
drivers
and
bodyguards
are
easier,
but
they
usually
don;t
have
real
access.
you
want
someone
with
enough
juice
to
be
hungry
for
more,
someone
desperate
to
make
a
move.
in
short,
you;re
looking
for
a
frustrated
middle
manager.
i
don;t
know
who
you
are.
i
don;t
know
what
you
want.
if
you
are
looking
for
ransom,
i
can
tell
you
i
don;t
have
money.
but
what
i
do
have
are
a
very
particular
set
of
skills;
skills
i
have
acquired
over
a
very
long
career.
skills
that
make
me
a
nightmare
for
people
like
you.
if
you
let
my
daughter
go
now,
that;ll
be
the
end
of
it.
i
will
not
look
for
you.
i
will
not
pursue
you.
but
if
you
don;t,
i
will
look
for
you,
i
will
find
you,
and
i
will
kill
you.
i;m
saying
you;re
what;s
wrong
with
america,
simpson.
you
coast
through
life,
you
do
as
little
as
possible
and
you
leach
your
decent
hardworking
people
like
me.
we
know
things
are
bad
-
worse
than
bad.
they;re
crazy.
it;s
like
everything
everywhere
is
going
crazy
so
we
don;t
go
out
anymore.
we
sit
in
the
house
and
slowly
the
world
we
are
living
in
is
getting
smaller
and
all
we
say
is,
"please,
at
least
leave
us
alone
in
our
living
rooms.
let
me
have
my
toaster
and
my
tv
and
my
steel-belted
radials
and

won;t

just
leave
us
alone."
to
protect
you
both
from
the
emperor,
you
were
hidden
from
your
father
when
you
were
born.
the
emperor
knew,
as
i
did,
if
anakin
were
to
have
any
offspring,
they
would
be
a
threat
to
him.
that
is
the
reason
why
your
sister
remains
safely
anonymous.
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart,
however,
she
was
waiting
for
something
to
happen.
like
shipwrecked
sailors,
she
turned
despairing
eyes
upon
the
solitude
of
her
life,
seeking
afar
off
some
white
sail
in
the
mists
of
the
horizon.
she
did
not
know
what
this
chance
would
be,
what
wind
would
bring
it
her,
towards
what
shore
it
would
drive
her,
if
it
would
be
a
shallop
or
a
three-decker,
laden
with
anguish
or
full
of
bliss
to
the
portholes.
but
each
morning,
as
she
awoke,
she
hoped
it
would
come
that
day;
she
listened
to
every
sound,
sprang
up
with
a
start,
wondered
that
it
did
not
come;
then
at
sunset,
always
more
saddened,
she
longed
for
the
morrow.
mom,
i
know
your
intentions
are
good
but
aren;t
the
police
the
protective
force
that
maintains
the
status
quo
for
the
wealthy
elite?
don;t
you
think
we
ought
to
attack
the
roots
of
social
problems
instead
of
jamming
people
into
overcrowded
prisons?
if
mr.
mcmurphy
doesn;t
want
to
take
his
medication
orally,
i;m
sure
we
can
arrange
that
he
can
have
it
some
other
way.
but
i
don;t
think
that
he
would
like
it.
life
seems
to
speed
up
as
we
get
older
because
life
gets
less
memorable
as
we
get
older.
earning
happiness
means
doing
good
and
working,
not
speculating
and
being
lazy.
laziness
may
look
inviting,
but
only
work
gives
you
true
satisfaction.
well,
nicky,
i
hate
to
point
out
the
obvious,
but
here;s
this
tiny
bird
that;s
been
trying
to
get
through
a
huge
bulletproof
glass
wall.
a
totally
impossible
situation.
you
tell
me
it;s
been
here
every
day
pecking
away
persistently
for
ten
minutes.
well,
today
the
glass
wall
came
down.
the
burned
hand
teaches
best.
after
that
advice
about
fire
goes
to
the
heart.
well,
father,
in
the
shipwreck
of
life,
for
life
is
an
eternal
shipwreck
of
our
hopes,
i
cast
into
the
sea
my
useless
encumbrance,
that
is
all,
and
i
remain
with
my
own
will,
disposed
to
live
perfectly
alone,
and,
consequently,
perfectly
free.
ok,
let
me
get
something
straight:
this
is
a
journal,
not
a
diary.
i
know
what
it
says
on
the
cover,
but
when
mom
went
out
to
buy
this
thing
i
specifically
told
her
to
get
one
that
didn;t
say
"diary"
on
it.
great.
all
i
need
is
some
jerk
to
catch
me
carrying
this
book
around
and
get
the
wrong
idea.
if
you
imagine
an
orange,
there
may
occur
in
your
cortex
a
set
of
commands
to
pick
it
up,
to
smell
it,
to
inspect
it,
and
so
on.
clearly
these
commands
cannot
be
carried
out,
because
the
orange
is
not
there.
but
they
can
be
sent
along
the
usual
channels
towards
the
cerebellum
or
other
suborgans
of
the
brain,
until,
at
some
critical
point,
a
"mental
faucet"

now
a
great
change
has
come
over
the

the

has
been
curtained
off
by
a

mass
of
clouds,
and
its
light
is
shut
off
from
the

the

of

shine
out
with
increased
distinctness;
the
moonlight
that
whitened
the
sides
of
the
buildings
now
has
left
them
black
masses
of
vague
shadow,
and
all
at
once
one
gets
the
impression
of
looking
down
into
an
inverted
firmament
studded
with
countless
stars
of
as
various
magnitudes
as
in
the
heavens,
from
the
bright
electric
arc-lights
to
tiny
gaslights;
and
from
this
height
of
over
400
feet
one
gets
the
impression,
familiar
to
those
who
have
looked
at
the
world
from
a
balloon,
that
the
rim
of
the
horizon
rises

appearances,
however,
he
felt
genuine
affection
for
his
mother.
his
letter
to
her
in
her
later
years
contain
lines
such
as
the
following:
"hello
mama
dear!

are
you
getting

how
are
you
feeling?
i
haven;t
had
any

from

a
detective
doesn;t
have
supernatural
powers.
there;s
no
way
to
predict
the
answer
from
the
beginning.
instead,
the
ideal
detective
begins
by
imagining
as
many
possible
scenarios
as
they
can.
they
envision
these
possibilities
without
prejudice,
without
bias,
using
only
their
logic
and
common
sense.
then,
as
they
investigate,
they
test
what
they
find
against
each
of
these
possibilities.
of
course,
me
telling
you
this
doesn;t
mean
you;ll
be
any
good
at
detective
work.
but
beyond
using
that
to
solve
this
particular
mystery,
you
should
keep
it
in

for
the

speculations
on

also
move
in
quite
another
direction.
the
development
of

led
to
the
recognition
of
the
fact,
that
we
can
cast
doubt
on
the

of
our

without
coming
into

with
the

mr.
hodge
began
explaining
the
point
of
the
hike,
something
about
fitting
into
nature,
finding
one;s
identity
through
connecting
with
one;s
environment.
"for
the
first
part
of
the
hike,
i
want
you
to
walk
in
complete
silence,
to
really
concentrate
on
what
you;re
seeing
around
you,"
he
said.
"then
we;ll
stop
and
chat
about
what
we;ve
discovered
in
that
silence."
it
is
only
with
the
heart
that
one
can
see
rightly;
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye.
but
something
stronger
than
death
was
summoning

compelling
him
-

had

the

between
them

infinite.
for
the

just
glances
at

and

the
other
dwells
duly
and

among
them.
the
one,
again,
begins
at
once
by
establishing
certain
abstract
and
useless
generalities,
the
other
rises
by
gradual
steps
to
that
which
is

so
if
you;re
feeling
lonely,
don;t.
you;re

i;ll

i
love

i
should.

caused
us

when
i
see

to
just
that
room.
and
then
i
remember,
and
i;m

that
gossip;s
eye
will
look
too
soon.
and
then
i;m
trapped,
overthinking.
and
yeah,

to

to

if
we
suppose
that
the
external
world
has
appeared
in
the

it
must
be
yoked
by
the
three
characteristics
-
appearance,
continuity,
and
destruction.
but
if
the
external
world
is
what
has
appeared,
how
is
it
possible
for
the
external
world
to
show
the
characteristics
that
the
external
world
shows
now
in
front
of
us?
the
things
we
do
outlast
our
mortality.
the
things
we
do
are
like
monuments
that
people
build
to
honor
heroes
after
they;ve
died.
they;re
like
the
pyramids
that
the
egyptians
built
to
honor
the
pharaohs.
only
instead
of
being
made
of
stone,
they;re
made
out
of
the
memories
people
have
of
you.

placed
my

crouched.

shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in

darkness
-
such
an
absolute
darkness
as
i
have
never
before
experienced.
the
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
there,
ready
to
flash
out
at
a
moment;s
notice.
to
me,
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
expectancy,
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
gloom,
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
vault.
to
continue,
you;ve
listened
to
a
long
and
complex
case,
murder
in
the
first
degree.
premeditated
murder
is
the
most
serious
charge
tried
in
our
criminal
courts.
you;ve
listened
to
the
testimony;
you;ve
had
the
law
read
to
you
and
interpreted
as
it
applies
in
this
case;
it;s
now
your
duty
to
sit
down
and
try
to
separate
the
facts
from
the
fancy.
i;ll
take
her
laughter
and
her
tears
and
make
them
all
my
souvenirs.
for
where
she
goes
i;ve
got
to
be.
the
meaning
of
my
life
is
she.
actually,
it;s
more
of
a
behavioral
observation.
like,
say
the
moose
in
question
was
seen
sniffing
a
flower,
which
according
to
the
first
moose
is
elk-like.
but
the
second
moose
isn;t
so
sure.
i
mean,
he
doesn;t
feel
like
an
elk,
he
doesn;t
have
elk
thoughts.
does
it
make
him
an
elk
just
because
he
likes
this
one
flower?
after
all,
your
chances
of
winning
a
lottery
and
of
affecting
an
election
are
pretty
similar.
from
a
financial
perspective,
playing
the
lottery
is
a
bad
investment.
but
it;s
fun
and
relatively
cheap:
for
the
price
of
a
ticket,
you
buy
the
right
to
fantasize
how
you;d
spend
the
winnings
-
much
as
you
get
to
fantasize
that
your
vote
will
have
some
impact
on
policy.
our
last
night
together
we
did
a
lot.
whole
lot.
but,
there
were
some
things
we
couldn;t
do.
alex;s
parents
had
already
bought
a
new
home,
most
of
the
neighborhood
had;
munch;s
too,
so
one-by-one
people
started
to
move,
my
parents
hadn;t
so
we
got
to
stay.
new
people
started
moving
in
and
mulberry
woods
started
again,
but
not
the
one
that
had
my
friends
in
it.
when
you;re
a
kid,
you
think
you;re
invisible.
you
think
you
can;t
make
a
difference.
we;re
not
kids
anymore!
we
know
now
that
we
can
do
anything!
having
a
friend
light
years
away
taught
us
that
distance,
is
just
a
state
of
mind.
if
you;re
best
friends
then
you
always
will
be
no
matter
where
you
are
in
the
universe.
do
you
want
to
make
the
most
valuable
purchase
you
can?
buy
a
juicer.
do
you
own
a
car?
sell
the
car
and
buy
a
juicer.
the
juicer
will
take
you
much
farther.
or
just
buy
the
juicer
now!
if
soldiers
are
punished
before
they
have
grown
attached
to
you,
they
will
not
prove
submissive;
and,
unless
submissive,
they
will
be
practically
useless.
if,
when
the
soldiers
have
become
attached
to
you,
punishments
are
not
enforced,
they
will
still
be
useless.

never
see

of

plan
this
thing
for

and
all
they
want
to
do
is

disgusted.
i;m

but
it;s
not
like

i;m
depressed.

i
killed

him
right
over
a

not

short-hand,
in
its
general
signification,
denotes
any
abbreviated

for

celerity,

i
can;t

to
be

i
could
do

was

aware
that
killing
people
is
crime
in
itself!

at
that
point
it
was
the
only
way
to
make
things
right!
i
thought
to
myself
that
someday
people
will
come
to
realize
this
as
much,
and
regard
it
as
an
act
of
justice!
i
had
no
choice

to
act
as
kira...

the
destiny
given
to
me.
i
was
chosen
to
renew
this
rotten
world,
to
bring
about

peace
-

utopia.

produce
a

you
must
choose

i
know
she;ll
be

the

me,
the
worst

at

we;ll
both
be

maniacs!
first
of
all,
you
must
be
comfortable,
otherwise
it
will
be
overly
tiring
and
very
difficult
to
concentrate.
many
races
have
been
lost
simply
because
a
driver
lost
concentration
due
to
discomfort
from
a
poorly
fitted
seat.
the
devil
found
a
clever
way
to
infiltrate
and
bring
his
manipulation;
a
slender
blonde
in
a
cocktail
dress
struggling
through
the
intoxication
brought
on
by
the
gifting
of
drinks
until
she
was
ready
to
pay
back
in
the
bedroom,
in
the
search
to
appease
the
demons
in
her
head
on
a
sterile
surface
in
the
bathroom.
i
was
proud
of
my
work.
and
the
buildings
went
up.
when
they
were
finished
the
damnedest
thing
happened.
it
was
like
the
buildings
were
too
good
for
us.
nobody
told
us
that.
it
just
felt
uncomfortable,
that;s
all.
if
you
are
given
too
many
choices,
if
you
are
forced
to
consider
much
more
than
your
unconscious
is
comfortable
with,
you
get
paralyzed.
snap
judgments
can
be
made
in
a
snap
because
they
are
frugal,
and
if
we
want
to
protect
our
snap
judgments,
we
have
to
take
steps
to
protect
that
frugality.
antoon

to
import

that;s
simply
too
expensive
now,
so
he;s
taken
to
making
his
own.
an
educated
man
who
is
proud
of
what
he;s
achieved,
he

how
his
workers
recycle
old

them
into

i
must
learn
to
be
content
with
being

i
deserve.
finish
each
day
and
be
done
with
it.
you
have
done
what
you
could.
some
blunders
and
absurdities
no
doubt
crept
in;
forget
them
as
soon
as
you
can.
tomorrow
is
a
new
day.
you
shall
begin
it
serenely
and
with
too
high
a
spirit
to
be
encumbered
with
your
old
nonsense.
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
lovely
princess,
but
she
had
an
enchantment
upon
her
of
a
fearful
sort
which
could
only
be
broken
by
love;s
first
kiss.
she
was
locked
away
in
a
castle
guarded
by
a
terrible
fire-breathing
dragon.
many
brave
knights
had
attempted
to
free
her
from
this
dreadful
prison,
but
none
prevailed.
she
waited
in
the
dragon;s
keep
in
the
highest
room
of
the
tallest
tower
for
her
true
love
and
true
love;s
first
kiss.
to
me
our
relationship
makes
perfect
sense.
you
want
me
to
propose
to
you,
i
propose
to
you.
you
say
no,
i
say
fine,
i
never
wanna
see
you
again.
you
drive
me
nuts
telling
me
you
want
me
to
propose
again,
i
do,
you
turn
me
down.
next
thing
i
know
i;m
in
a
court
of
law
where
i;ve
got
to
propose
to
you
or
go
to
jail.
it;s
the
classic
american
love
story.
now
this
one
upsets
me.
we
have
an
out-of-tune
player.
before
i
go
any
further,
does
that
player
want
to
do
the
right
thing
and
reveal
himself?
okay.
maybe
a
bug
flew
in
my
ear...
no,
i
guess
my
ears
are
clean
because
we
most
definitely
have
an
out-of-tune
player.
whoever
it
is,
this
is
your
last
chance.
either
you
know
you
are
out
of
tune,
and
are
therefore
deliberately
sabotaging
my
band;
or
you
do
not
know
you;re
out
of
tune
-
which
i;m
afraid
is
even
worse.
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning,
tell
yourself:
the
people
i
deal
with
today
will
be
meddling,
ungrateful,
arrogant,
dishonest,
jealous
and
surly.
they
are
like
this
because
they
can;t
tell
good
from
evil.
but
i
have
seen
the
beauty
of
good,
and
the
ugliness
of
evil,
and
have
recognized
that
the
wrongdoer
has
a
nature
related
to
my
own
-
not
of
the
same
blood
and
birth,
but
the
same
mind,
and
possessing
a
share
of
the
divine.
and
so
none
of
them
can
hurt
me.
no
one
can
implicate
me
in
ugliness.
nor
can
i
feel
angry
at
my
relative,
or
hate
him.
we
were
born
to
work
together
like
feet,
hands
and
eyes,
like
the
two
rows
of
teeth,
upper
and
lower.
to
obstruct
each
other
is
unnatural.
to
feel
anger
at
someone,
to
turn
your
back
on
him:
these
are
unnatural.
you
are
the
breath
of
your
creator,
and
as
he
breathes
in
and
out,
you
live.
remember
that,
for
that
sums
up
everything
that
you
need
to
know
about
your
god.
there
is
first
an
exhalation
from
god,
on
the
part
of
all
creation;
and
then,
at
a
certain
point,
it
starts
its
journey
back,
its
inhalation.
this
cycle
never
ceases.
you
leave
me;
you
are
away
from
me;
you
start
back;
you
rejoin
me.
you
and
everything
else.
it
is
a
process,
an
event.
it
is
an
activity
-
my
activity.
it
is
the
rhythm
of
my
own
being,
and
it
sustains
you
all.
maybe
every
human
soul
deals
with
loss
and
grief
in
its
own
way.
some
curse
the
darkness.
some
play
hide
and
seek.
that
night
paul
and
winnie
and
i
found
something
we
almost
lost.
we
found
our
spirit.
the
spirit
of
children.
the
bond
of
memory.
and
the
next
day
they
tore
down
harper;s
woods.
there;s
something
way
down
deep
that;s
eternal
about
every
human
being.
in
my
restless
dreams,
i
see
that
town...
silent
hill.
you
promised
me
you;d
take
me
there
again
someday...
but
you
never
did.
well
i;m
alone
there
now,
in
our
special
place...
waiting
for
you.
i
dream
of
rain,
i
dream
of
gardens
in
the
desert
sand.
i
wake
in
vain.
i
dream
of
love
as
time
runs
through
my
hand.
now
that
i
know
that
i;m
breaking
to
pieces,
i;ll
pull
out
my
heart
and
i;ll
feed
it
to
anyone.
crying
for
sympathy,
crocodiles
cry
for
the
love
of
the
crowd
and
the
free
cheers
from
everyone.
dropping
through
sky,
through
the
glass
of
the
roof,
through
the
roof
of
your
mouth,
through
the
mouth
of
your
eye,
through
the
eye
of
the
needle,
it;s
easier
for
me
to
get
closer
to
heaven
than
ever
feel
whole
again.
you
speak
in
abbreviations
because
real
life
conversation
moves
too
slowly.
you;re
the
media;s
creation,
yeah,
your
free
will
has
been
taken
and
you
don;t
know.
my
feeling
is
if
you;re
the
ceo
of
a
company
and
you;re
dumb
enough
to
leave
your
login
info
on
a
post-it
note
on
your
desk,
while
the
people
that
you
ripped
off
are
physically
in
your
office,
it;s
not
a
hack.
it;s
barely
social
engineering.
it;s
more
like
natural
selection.
we
acquire
a
taste
for
salt.
by
consuming
less
salt,
we
can
lose
this
acquired
taste.
this
has
happened
to
me
and
i
find
that
i
no
longer
like
the
salty
taste
of
ham
or
bacon.
processed
foods
often
have
sodium
added
and
provide
us
with
far
more
sodium
than
fresh
foods.
limiting
processed
foods,
limiting
salt
at
the
table,
and
limiting
salt
used
in
cooking
are
the
three
main
ways
to
reduce
sodium
in
your
diet.

oh
yeah,

dedication,
devotion,
turning
all
the
night
time
into
the
day.
after
living
with
you
for
the
last
six
months,
i;m
turning
into
one
of
your
scripts.
well,
this
is
not
a
script,
diana.
there;s
some
real,
actual
life
going
on
here.
this
business
is
filled
to
the
brim
with
unrealistic
people
who
thought
their
bods
aged
like
wine.
if
you
mean
it
turns
to
vinegar,
it
does.
if
you
mean
it
gets
better
with
age,
it
don;t.
besides
butch,
how
many
fights
you
think
you
got
left
in
you
anyway?
two?
boxers
don;t
have
an
old
timer;s
pension.
you
came
close,
but
you
never
made
it,
and
if
you
were
gonna
make
it,
you
woulda
made
it
by
now.
i
really
don;t
mind
the
rain
and
a
smile
can
hide
all
the
pain.
but
you;re
down
when
you;re
ridin;
the
train
that;s
takin;
the
long
way.
sometimes
you
picture
me.
i;m
walking
too
far
ahead,
you;re
calling
to
me,
i
can;t
hear
what
you;ve
said.
then
you
say,
"go
slow."
i
fall
behind,
the
second
hand
unwinds.
well,
gentlemen,
in
my
opinion,
if
we
send
him
back
to
pendleton
or
we
send
him
up
to
disturbed,
it;s
just
one
more
way
of
passing
on
our
problems
to
somebody
else.
you
know
we
don;t
like
to
do
that,
so
i;d
like
to
keep
him
on
the
ward.
i
think
we
can
help
him.
and
to
think,
if
it
weren;t
for
you...
i
never
would;ve
danced
at
all.
if
thou
workest
at
that
which
is
before
thee,
following
right
reason
seriously,
vigorously,
calmly,
without
allowing
anything
else
to
distract
thee,
but
keeping
thy
divine
part
pure,
as
if
thou
shouldst
be
bound
to
give
it
back
immediately;
if
thou
holdest
to
this,
expecting
nothing,
fearing
nothing,
but
satisfied
with
thy
present
activity
according
to
nature,
and
with
heroic
truth
in
every
word
and
sound
which
thou
utterest,
thou
wilt
live
happy.
and
there
is
no
man
who
is
able
to
prevent
this.
lucid
but
wholly
false
recollections
can
easily
be
induced
by
a
few
cues
and
questions.
memory
can
be
contaminated.
false
memories
can
be
implanted
even
in
minds
that
do
not
consider
themselves

and
uncritical.
look,
you;re
supposed
to
be
winning
the
hearts
and
minds
of
the

isn;t
that
the
whole
point
of
your
little
puppet
show?
if
you
walk
like
them,
you
talk
like
them,
they;ll
trust
you.
we

but
after
-
how
many
years
-
the
relations
with
the
indigenous
are
only
getting
worse.
i;ve
been
trying
to
get
answers
from
him.
where
does
he
come
from?
how
does
he
do
what
he
does?
but
he
dodges
everything,
literally,
with
this
super-speed
power.
when
he
moves,
barry,
you
don;t
even
see
him.
he
comes
and
goes
in
the
blink
of
an
eye,
in
a...
not
too
many
days
from
this
day,
not
too
many
hours
from
this
hour.
so
long?
the
storm
comes,
or
is
it
just
another
shower?
i
am
fundamentally
an
optimist.
whether
that
comes
from
nature
or
nurture,
i
cannot
say.
part
of
being
optimistic
is
keeping
one;s
head
pointed
toward
the
sun,
one;s
feet
moving
forward.
there
were
many
dark
moments
when
my
faith
in
humanity
was
sorely
tested,
but
i
would
not
and
could
not
give
myself
up
to
despair.
that
way
lays
defeat
and
death.
a
man
may
fish
with
the
worm
that
hath
eat
of
a
king,
and
eat
of
the
fish
that
hath
fed
of
that
worm.
math
is
like
an
atomic-powered
prosthesis
that
you
attach
to
your
common
sense,
vastly
multiplying
its
reach
and
strength.
despite
the
power
of
mathematics,
and
despite
its
sometimes
forbidding
notation
and
abstraction,
the
actual
mental
work
involved
is
little
different
from
the
way
we
think
about
down-to-earth
problems.
because
they;re
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale,
nerds
are
a
safe
target
for
the
entire
school.
if
i
remember
correctly,
the
most
popular
kids
don;t
persecute
nerds;
they
don;t
need
to
stoop
to
such
things.
most
of
the
persecution
comes
from
kids
lower
down,
the
nervous
middle
classes.
you
ask
raymond
what
he
does
for
a
living
and
he
says,
"i
breathe
and
walk
and
when
i;m
told
to
sit
i
sit
and
when
i;m
told
to
leave
i
leave
and
return
home
to
luxuriate
and
think
how
much
i
despise
them."
he
implies
there
is
a
correlation
between
his
daily
work
and
the
drawings,
which
leads
people
to
believe
he
is
some
type
of
an
architect,
but
you
suspect
there
is
no
place
for
him
with
even
the
most
incompetent
firm.
i
didn;t
know
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end.
justin,
you
were
in
love
with
my
friend
kat.
my
only
friend.
so
you
see,
that;s
where
the
trouble
began.
that
smile.
that
damned
smile.
i
had
the
same
room
which
finny
and
i
had
shared
during
the
summer,
but
across
the
hall,
in
the
large
suite
where
leper
lepellier
had
dreamed
his
way
through
july
and
august
amid
sunshine
and
dust
motes
and
windows
through
which
the
ivy
had
reached
tentatively
into
the
room,
here
brinker
hadley
had
established
his
headquarters.
there
have
been
occasions
in
my
later
life
(i
suppose
as
in
most
lives)
when
i
have
felt
for
a
time
as
if
a
thick
curtain
had
fallen
on
all
its
interest
and
romance,
to
shut
me
out
from
anything
save
dull
endurance
any
more.
never
has
that
curtain
dropped
so
heavy
and
blank,
as
when
my
way
in
life
lay
stretched
out
straight
before
me
through
the
newly-entered
road
of
apprenticeship
to
joe.
at
that
very
moment,
time
stopped,
as
it
was
wont
to
do
when
present,
past,
and
future
collide;
when
one;s
existence
ceases
to
be
measured
in
days,
hours,
and
minutes,
but
instead
in
immeasurable
quantity
of
life
events.
that;s
tommy.
he
tells
people
he
was
named
after
a
gun,
but
i
know
he
was
really
named
after
a
famous
19th
century
ballet
dancer.
i
turned
back,
and
perceived
a
vast
opaque
body
between
me
and
the
sun
moving
forwards
towards
the
island:
it
seemed
to
be
about
two
miles
high,
and
hid
the
sun
six
or
seven
minutes;
but
i
did
not
observe
the
air
to
be
much
colder,
or
the
sky
more
darkened,
than
if
i
had
stood
under
the
shade
of
a
mountain.
for
restless
eyes
egos
burn
and
the
mold
is
hard
to
break.
now
we;ve
waded
in
too
deep
and
love
is
overboard.
heavy
hearts,
token
words,
all
the
hopes
i
ever
had
fade
like
footprints
in
the
sand.
you
no
good
little
slimebag!
i;m
going
to
make
you
the
second
most
miserable
cab
driver
in
new
york
city!
i;ll
make
sure
your
windows
don;t
open
in
the
summer,
and
that
the
heating
doesn;t
work
in
the
winter!
i;ll
take
the
headrest
off
your
driver;s
seat
and
send
you
to
the
most
desolate
parts
of
town!
the
most
miserable
cab
driver
in
new
york
is
the
one
that
either
lets
him
down...
or
feeds
him!
his
chess
ideas
are
like
pieces
of
his
body
he;s
reluctant
to
give
up.
for
instance,
he
simply
can;t
cope
with
being
told
not
to
bring
his
queen
out
too
early
in
the
game.
why
shouldn;t
he?
he;s
won
many
a
game
in
washington
square
doing
exactly
that,
why
is
this
suddenly
wrong?
unjust
laws
exist:
shall
we
be
content
to
obey
them,
or
shall
we
endeavor
to
amend
them,
and
obey
them
until
we
have
succeeded,
or
shall
we
transgress
them
at
once?
men,
generally,
under
such
a
government
as
this,
think
that
they
ought
to
wait
until
they
have
persuaded
the
majority
to
alter
them.
they
think
that,
if
they
should
resist,
the
remedy
would
be
worse
than
the
evil.
but
it
is
the
fault
of
the
government
itself
that
the
remedy
is
worse
than
the
evil.
it
makes
it
worse.
it
is
a
truth
universally
acknowledged,
that
a
single
man
in
possession
of
a
good
fortune,
must
be
in
want
of
a
wife.
i
ran
out
of
tears
when
i
was
18,
so
nobody
made
me
but
the
main
streets.
;cause
too
many
people
think
they
made
me.
well,
if
they

for
the

of

oh,
i;ve
seen
bad
movies
before.
but
they
usually
made
me
care
about
how
bad
they
were.
watching
"mad

is
like
waiting

you;re

simply
because
it
appalls

but
the
grey
face
still
followed
me.
it
murmured,
and
i
understood
that
it
desired
to
confess
something.
i
felt
my
soul
receding
into
some
pleasant
and
vicious
region;
and
there
again
i
found
it
waiting
for
me.
i
had
the
impression
of
being
abandoned
by
everyone
when
the
whole
city
rose
and
left
for
the
summer.
i
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone,
and
for
three
days
i
roamed
dejectedly
through
the
city,
unable
to
understand
what
was
happening
to
me.
whether
i
went
to
nevsky
avenue,
to
the
park,
or
wandered
along
the
embankments,
i
never
came
across
the
people
i
was
accustomed
to
meet
in
certain
spots
at
certain
hours
all
year
round.
they,
of
course,
didn;t
know
me;
but
i
knew
them
all
right.
the
last
thing
he
said
to
me,
"doc,"
he
said,
"some
time
when
the
crew
is
up
against
it,
and
the
breaks
are
beating
the
boys,
tell
them
to
get
out
there
and
give
it
all
they
got
and
win
just
one
for
the
zipper.
i
don;t
know
where
i;ll
be
then,

he
said,
"but
i
won;t
smell
too
good,
that;s
for

lord
paladin
tirion
fordring
was
a
powerful
man.
he
was
strong
in
both
mind
and
body,
and
was
counted
as
one
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
his
day.
though
he
was
slightly
over
fifty
years
of
age,
he
still
looked
as
fit
and
dynamic
as
he
had
when
a
younger
man.
his
signature
bushy
mustache
and
his
neatly
trimmed
brown
hair
were
streaked
with
gray,
but
his
piercing
green
eyes
still
shone
with
an
energy
that
belied
his
years.
at
first
they
had
tried
to
keep
the
finding
quiet.
after
all,
they
were
not
absolutely
sure
it
was
an
extraterrestrial
message.
a
premature
or
mistaken
announcement
would
be
a
public
relations
disaster.
but
worse
than
that,
it
would
interfere
with
the
data
analysis.
if
the
press
descended,
the
science
would
surely
suffer.
i
feel
it
deep
within,
it;s
just
beneath
the
skin.
i
must
confess
that
i
feel
like
a
monster.
i
hate
what
i;ve
become,
the
nightmare;s
just
begun.
i
must
confess
that
i
feel
like
a
monster.
i,
i
feel
like
a
monster.
i,
i
feel
like
a
monster.
and
now,
as
i
close
my
task,
subduing
my
desire
to
linger
yet,
these
faces
fade
away.
but
one
face,
shining
on
me
like
a
heavenly
light
by
which
i
see
all
other
objects,
is
above
them
and
beyond
them
all.
and
that
remains.
when
a
man;s
an
empty
kettle,
he
should
be
on
his
mettle,
and
yet
i;m
torn
apart.
just
because
i;m
presumin;
that
i
could
be
kinda
human
if
i
only
had
a
heart.
morality,
it
could
be
argued,
represents
the
way
that

to

actually
does

i
hope
you
will
love
your
baby.
i
hope
it
will
be

that
husband
of
yours,
i
hope,
will
always
treat
you
well,
because
otherwise
my
specter
shall
come
out
of
him,
like

like
a

pull
him
apart

as
he
proceeded
toward
the
chateau;s
minarets,
it
was
difficult
not
to
marvel
at
the
falls
below.
it
was
a
magnificent
sight,
watching
that
water
fall
off
the
edge
of
the
world
and
into
the
misty
clouds
below.
as
single-minded
as
karzt
was,
he
was
glad
for
the
chance
to
see
one
of
the
great
wonders
of
genesis.
he
pulled
a
whetstone
out
of
his
backpack
and
walked
back
to
the
carriage,
leaning
against
its
wheeled
frame
while
idly
running
the
stone
over
the
edge
of
his
hatchet
blade.
he
knew
that
it
would
need
sharpening
for
the
days
ahead,
especially
considering
that
he;d
blunted
it
recently
during
the
encounter
with
those
creatures.
advisors
and
scholars
will
tell
you
that
history
is
a
narrative
of
strength.
they
will
recount
stories
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
nations
and
empires.
there
will
be
stories
of
armies,
battles,
and
decisive
victories.
but
this
isn;t
true
strength
-
it;s
merely
power.
i
now
believe
true
strength
is
found
in
vulnerability.
in
forgiveness.
in
love.
there
is
a
beautiful,
upside-down
truth,
which
is
that
these
moments
of
purest
strength
appear
as
weakness
to
those
who
don;t
know
better.
for
a
long
time,
i
didn;t
know
better.
i
ask
you
and
your
brother
to
reject
history
as
a
narrative
of
strength,
and
instead,
have
faith
that
it
can
be
a
narrative
of
love.
just
as
people
behave
to
me,
so
do
i
behave
to
them.
when
i
see
that
a
person
despises
me
and
treats
me
with
contempt,
i
can
be
as
proud
as
any
peacock.
when
adults
say,
"teenagers

they

with
that
sly,
stupid
smile
on
their

they
don;t
know
how
right
they
are.
we
need
never
be
hopeless,
because
we
can
never
be
irreparably
broken.
we
think
that
we
are
invincible
because
we
are.
we
cannot
be
born,
and
we
cannot
die.
like
all

we
can
only
change
shapes

manifestations.
they
forget
that
when
they

but
that

you
suppose

must

not

far,
far

waiting
round

and
me.
what
was
observed
by
us
in
the
third
place
is
the
nature
or
matter
of
the
milky
way
itself,
which,
with
the
aid
of
the
spyglass,
may
be
observed
so
well
that
all
the
disputes
that
for
so
many
generations
have
vexed

are
destroyed
by

certainty,

we
are

i;ve
always
wondered
about
this
coat
business.
when
i;m
in
a
theater,
i
either
fold
mine
in
my
lap
or
throw
it
over
my
armrest,
but
patsy
always
spreads
hers
out,
acting
as
if
the
seat
back
were
cold,
and
she
couldn;t
possibly
enjoy
herself
while
it
was
suffering.
my
hours
of
leisure
i
spent
in
reading
the
best
authors,
ancient
and
modern,
being
always
provided
with
a
good
number
of
books;
and
when
i
was
ashore,
in
observing
the
manners
and
dispositions
of
the
people,
as
well
as
learning
their
language;
wherein
i
had
a
great
facility,
by
the
strength
of
my
memory.
i
was
watching
a
television
program
before
with
a
kind
of
roving
moderator
who
spoke
to
a
seated
panel
of
young
women
who
were
having
some
sort
of
problem
with
their
boyfriends
apparently
because
the
boyfriends
had
all
slept
with
the
girlfriends;
mothers.
and
they
brought
the
boyfriends
out,
and
they
fought
right
there
on
television.

tell
me:

don;t

they?
i
used
to

in

when
bill
gates
got
married
on
lanai,
he
rented
every
helicopter
on
the
hawaiian
islands
so
that
paparazzi
couldn;t
use
them
to
fly
over.
although
in
that
case,
it
was
a
positive,
because
now
you
can
imagine
that
wedding
however
you
want.
i
confess
that
fermat;s
theorem
as
an
isolated
proposition
has
very
little
interest
for
me,
because
i
could
easily
lay
down
a
multitude
of
such
propositions,
which
one
could
neither
prove
nor
dispose
of.
i
celebrate
myself,
and
sing

what
i
assume

shall
assume,

every
atom

to

have
won,
and
all
the
copyists

the
tribute
bands

won,
if
we
allow
our
culture
to
be
shaped
by
mimicry,

it
from
lack

don;t
just
regurgitate
creative

hold

the
people
who
try
to
"guard"
any
particular
form
of
music
are,
like
the
copyists
and
manufactured
bands,
doing
it
the
worst
disservice,
because
the
only
thing
that
you
can
do
to
music
that
will
damage
it
is
not
change
it,
not
make
it
your
own.
because
then
it
dies,
then
it;s
over,
then
it;s
done,

the
boy
bands
have
won.

everybody,
i

never

speak
out
your
compliment

point-blank
in

man;s
face,
and
behind
his
back,

you
know
there
is

of
his
hearing
it
again.

never

tough
it
is,

the
perfection
of
human
nature.
but
a
paradox
of
modern
communication
is
that,
while
it
links
together
disparate
regions
and
identities,
it
also
creates
new
awareness
of
disparities.
it
does
not
only
homogenize
things.
ideas
blend
and
mix
and
become
hybrid,
but
in
different
ways
in
different
places.
space
is
big.
really
big.
you
just
won;t
believe
how
vastly
hugely
mindbogglingly
big
it
is.
i
mean
you
may
think
it;s
a
long
way
down
the
road
to
the

but
that;s
just
peanuts
to
space.
my
friend,
do
you
fly
away
now?
to
a
world
that
abhors
you
and
i?
all
that
awaits
you
is
a
somber
morrow.
no
matter
where
the
winds
may
blow.
my
friend,
your
desire,
is
the
bringer
of
life,
the
gift
of
the
goddess.
even
if
the
morrow
is
barren
of
promises,
nothing
shall
forestall
my
return.
kids,
there;s
nothing
more
cool
than
being
hugged
by
someone
you
like.
but
if
someone
tries
to
touch
you
in
a
place
or
in
a
way
that
makes
you
feel
uncomfortable,
that;s
no
good!
it;s
your
body.
no
one
has
the
right
to
touch
you
if
you
don;t
want
them
to.
so
what
do
you
do?
first,
you
say
;no!;
then,
you
get
outta
there!
most
important,
you
gotta
tell
someone
you
trust,
like
your
parents,
your
teacher,
a
police
officer.
she
seemed
to
know,
to
accept,
to
welcome
her
position,
the
citadel
of
the
family,
the
strong
place
that
could
not
be
taken.
and
since
old
tom
and
the
children
could
not
know
hurt
or
fear
unless
she
acknowledged
hurt
or
fear,
she
had
practiced
denying
them
in
herself.
and
since,
when
a
joyful
thing
happened,
they
looked
to
see
whether
joy
was
on
her,
it
was
her
habit
to
build
up
laughter
out
of
inadequate
materials.
she
seemed
to
know
that
if
she
swayed
the
family
shook,
and
if
she
ever
deeply
wavered
or
despaired
the
family
would
fall.
she
belonged
to
a
different
age,
but
being
so
entire,
so
complete,
would
always
stand
up
on
the
horizon,
stone-white,
eminent,
like
a
lighthouse
marking
some
past
stage
on
this
adventurous,
long,
long
voyage,
this
interminable
-
this
interminable
life.
from
birth
to
old
age,
the
body
undergoes
many
changes.
as
we
get
older,
these
changes
alter
the
ways
that
the
body
can
compensate
for
the
stress
of
illness
or
injury.
it
is
important
to
understand
the
physiology
of
normal
aging
in
order
to
anticipate
an
older
person;s
response
to
changing
conditions.
activities
that
were
done
easily
as
a
younger
person
may
become
more
difficult
or
impossible,
requiring
additional
help
or
changes
in
the

that

people
in

who
have
more
opportunity
for
getting
close
to
the
hot,
interesting

than
the
special
correspondent
of
a
great
paper.
he

the

times
the
drama
of

is
to
him
like
the

are
no

the
account

to
some
extent
like
that
of

that
the

either
to
confirm

reverse

on

it
is

place:
when
the

is
in,
a
wave-churned
basin,
creamy
with
foam,
whipped
by
the
combers
that
roll
in
from
the
whistling

on

when

goes
out

the
way
i
see
it,
and
hey,
i;m
no
intelligent

like
you,
but
the
way
i
see
it,
there;s
two
great
evils
that
bedevil
american
capitalism
of
the
kind
you
practice.
number
one
is
outsourcing.
you
paid
a
private
company
to
do
your
dirty
work,
and
then
you
underpaid
that
company
because
you
thought
you
were
big
enough
and
bad
enough
that
you
didn;t
have
to
play
by
the
rules.
oh,
number
two:
off-shoring
your
profits.
begin

friendly
voice.
a

that
song
that;s
so
elusive,
and
the
magic
music
makes
your
morning
mood.
off
on
your
way,
hit
the
open
road.
there
is
magic
at
your
fingers
for
the
spirit
ever
lingers
undemanding
contact
in
your
happy
solitude.
i
don;t
want
you
to
think
of
this
as
just
a
film
-
some
process
of
converting
electrons
and
magnetic
impulses
into
shapes
and
figures
and
sounds.
no.
listen
to
me.
we;re
here
to
make
a
dent
in
the
universe.
otherwise,
why
even
be
here?
we;re
creating
a
completely
new
consciousness,
like
an
artist
or
poet.
that;s
how
you
have
to
think
of
this.
we;re
rewriting
the
history
of
human
thought
with
what
we;re
doing.
the
idea
of
having
nations
and
governments
is
as
foolish
as
keeping
the
human
and
spirit
realms
separate.
you;ve
had
to
deal
with
a
moronic
president
and
a
tyrannical
queen.
don;t
you
think
the
world
would
be
better
off
if
leaders
like
them
were
eliminated?
there;s
only
one
person
in
the
world
who;s
going
to
decide
what
i;m
going
to
do
and
that;s
me.
i
hate
bactine
because
it
gets
on
my
fingers
and
i
get
eczema
from
the
lidocaine.
i
don;t
think
man
was
meant
to
attain
happiness
so
easily.
happiness
is
like
those
palaces
in
fairy
tales
whose
gates
are
guarded
by
dragons:
we
must
fight
in
order
to
conquer
it.
now
the
scandal
and
the
light
are
to
be
distributed
differently;
it
is
the
conviction
itself
that
marks
the
offender
with
the
unequivocally
negative
sign:
the
publicity
has
shifted
to
the
trial,
and
to
the
sentence.
they
reminded
me
that
it
was
my
fate
to
pursue
only
phantoms,
creatures
whose
reality
existed
to
a
great
extent
in
my
imagination;
for
there
are
people
-
and
this
had
been
my
case
since
youth
-
for
whom
all
the
things
that
have
a
fixed
value,
assessable
by
others,
fortune,
success,
high
positions,
do
not
count;
what
they
must
have
is
phantoms.
they
sacrifice
all
the
rest,
devote
all
their
efforts,
make
everything
else
subservient
to
the
pursuit
of
some
phantom.
but
this
soon
fades
away;
then
they
run
after
another
only
to
return
later
on
to
the
first.
on
other
wavelengths
there
would
probably
be
a
lot
still
to
see,
but
the
mess-room
screen
was
on
normal
light.
only
the
minds,
only
the
starships,
would
see
the
whole
destruction
perfectly;
only
they
would
be
able
to
appreciate
it
for
all
that
it
had
to
offer.
of
the
entire
range
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum,
the
unaided
human
eye
could
see
little
more
than
one
percent:
a
single
octave
of
radiation
out
of
an
immense
long
keyboard
of
tones.
hey,
sid!
remember
that
time
last
summer
we
were
all
gathered
around
the
kill
like
this,
someone
told
a
leopard
joke,
and
you
laughed
so
hard
an
antler
came
out
of
your
nose?
your
friend,
mr.
lincoln
had
his
taylors
and
paines.
so
did
every
other
man
who
ever
tried
to
lift
his
thought
up
off
the
ground.
odds
against
them
didn;t
stop
those
men.
they
were
fools
that
way.
all
the
good
that
ever
came
into
this
world
came
from
fools
with
faith
like
that.
you
know
that,
jeff.
you
can;t
quit
now.
not
you.
they
aren;t
all
taylors
and
paines
in
washington.
that
kind
just
throw
big
shadows,
that;s
all.
when
you
have
children,
you
always
have
family.
they
will
always
be
your
priority,
your
responsibility.
and
a
man,
a
man
provides.
and
he
does
it
even
when
he;s
not
appreciated,
or
respected,
or
even
loved.
he
simply
bears
up
and
he
does
it.
because
he;s
a
man.
all
i
asked
was
for
you
to
behave
like
a
princess.
even
royalty
must
obey
rules.

the
rest
up

hey,
alex
-
you
know
the
really
great
thing
about

if
something
important

anywhere
in
the

or
day...
you
can
always
change
the
channel.
johnny,
i
got
a
lot
of
people
here
who
are
a
little
depressed
because
the
war
just
ended.
please
give
me
a
new
song.
i
walked
into
the
store.
after
the
buzzing
and
booming
of
the
entertainment
center,
the
hardware
store
seemed
as
quiet
as
the
interior
of
an
iceberg.
next
to
the
razor
sets,
i
found
nail
clippers
arrayed
like
entomological
specimens.
i
picked
up
the
most
featureless
of
the
lot
and
took
it
over
to
the
register.
in
his
blue
gardens
men
and
girls
came
and
went
like
moths
among
the
whisperings
and
the
champagne
and
the
stars.
the
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled
a
dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
greatcoat.
as
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
column,
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
knee,
i
took
a
good
look
at
the
man
and
endeavored,
after
the
fashion
of
my
companion,
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
appearance.
the
shearers;
hut
had
bark
walls
and
a
tin
roof.
the
floors
were
dirt
and
there
was
a
long
table
down
the
centre
of
the
shed.
three
tiers
of
bunks
ran
all
the
way
around
each
wall.
paddy
dropped
his
bedroll
onto
one
of
the
bunks.
after
sleeping
on
the
ground
for
months,
a
hessian
sack
filled
with
chaff
felt
like
heaven.
there
are
three
reasons,
mr.
brown,
why
i
will
not
dance
with
you.
the
first,
i
fear,
is
that
you;ve
had
a
little
too
much
to
drink.
the
second
is
that
this
is
not,
as
you
seem
to
suppose,
a
waltz
the
orchestra
is
playing
but
the
peruvian
national
anthem,
for
which
you
should
be
standing
to
attention.
and
the
third
reason
why
we
may
not
dance,
mr.
brown,
is
that
i
am
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
lima.
my
life
seems
unreal,
my
crime
an
illusion,
a
scene
badly
written
in
which
i
must
play.
yet
i
know
as
i
gaze
at
my
young
love
beside
me
the
morning
is
just
a
few
hours
away.
i
didn;t
wanna
spend
my
twenties
as
a
professional
defendant.
who
knew
the
music
industry
doesn;t
have
a
sense
of
humor?
we
tried
to
sell
the
company
to
pay
the
35
million
they
said
we
owed
in
royalties,
but
i
guess
to
them
that
was
a
little
like
selling
a
stolen
car
to
pay
for
the
stolen
gas.
it
was
a
wicked,
whimpering,
winter
plagued
night.
when
my
tongue
grew
wings,
and
took
to
flight.
the
thought
had
never
crossed
my
mind
before
that
moment.
it;s
the
truth
so
bent,
it
can;t
be
broken.
the
bird,
the
pin,
the
song,
the
berries,
the
watch,
the
cracker,
the
dress
that
burst
into
flames.
i
am
the
mockingjay.
the
one
that
survived
despite
the
capitol;s
plans.
the
symbol
of
the
rebellion.
the
light
lives
in
all
places.
in
all
things.
you
can
block
it.
even
try
to
trap
it.
but
the
light
will
always
find
its
way.
witness
my
evil
dream
to
rid
mobius
of
music
and
fun
forever.
my
latest
invention,
the
mean
bean-steaming
machine
will
not
only
dispose
of
those
fun-loving
jolly
beans
of
beanville
but
turn
them
into
robot
slaves
to
serve
my
evil
purposes.
robots.
bring
me
those
beans.
all
i;m
trying
to
say,
tommy,
is
that
if
you
could
just
prove
who
you
really
are,
you;d
be
free!
don;t
you
understand,
they
don;t
understand
you!
they
don;t
believe
you.
believe
me,
they
think
you;re
one
of
us.
they
think
you;re
a
freak
-
or
a
fake.
i
know
you;re
not.
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
prove
it
to
;em.
let
;em
see
you
as
you
really
are!
for
me,
halloween
is
the
best
holiday
in
the
world.
it
even
beats
christmas.
i
get
to
dress
up
in
a
costume.
i
get
to
wear
a
mask.
i
get
to
go
around
like
every
other
kid
with
a
mask
and
nobody
thinks
i
look
weird.
nobody
takes
a
second
look.
nobody
notices
me.
nobody
knows
me.
i
wish
every
day
could
be
halloween.
we
could
all
wear
masks
all
the
time.
then
we
could
walk
around
and
get
to
know
each
other
before
we
got
to
see
what
we
looked
like
under
the
masks.
did
it
matter
then,
she
asked
herself,
walking
towards
bond
street,
did
it
matter
that
she
must
inevitably
cease
completely;
all
this
must
go
on
without
her;
did
she
resent
it;
or
did
it
not
become
consoling
to
believe
that
death
ended
absolutely?
dear
slim,
you
still
ain;t
called
or
wrote,
i
hope
you
have
a
chance.
i
ain;t
mad,
i
just
think
it;s
messed
up
you
don;t
answer
fans.
if
you
didn;t
want
to
talk
to
me
outside
the
concert
you
didn;t
have
to,
but
you
could;ve
signed
an
autograph
for
matthew.
that;s
my
little
brother,
man,
he;s
only
six
years
old.
we
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
for
four
hours,
and
you
just
said
no.
the
dude
has
a
photographic
memory.
every
time
he
thinks
he
might
forgive
you,
the
image
of
you
smashing
his
artwork
just
pops
into
his
head.
not
that
i;ve
discussed
it
with
him.
convection
also
plays
a
minor
role
because
of
the
relative
thinness
of
the
air
layer
and
the
presence
of
the
upper
cardboard
heat
shield.
the
insulation
properties
of
the
cardboard
play
a
major
role,
since
they
serve
to
minimize
the
temperature
gradient
across
the
airspace.
i;ll
tell
you
a
secret.
something
they
don;t
teach
you
in
your
temple.
the
gods
envy
us.
they
envy
us
because
we;re
mortal,

i
was
a
son.
a
brother,
like
you,
a
younger
brother,
and
i
had
an
older
brother
who
i
loved.
idolized,
in
fact.
and
one
day
i
went
to
him
and
i
begged
him
to
stand
with
me,
and
michael...
michael
turned
on
me.
called
me
a
freak.
a
monster.
and
then
he
beat
me
down.
all
because
i
was
different.
because
i
had
a
mind
of
my
own.
this
world
is
rotten,
and
those
who
are
making
it
rot
deserve
to
die!
someone
has
to
do
it,
so
why
not
me?
even
if
it
means
sacrificing
my
own
mind
and
soul,
it;s
worth
it.
because
the
world
can;t
go
on
like
this!
i
wonder
what
if
someone
else
had
picked
up
this
notebook?
is
there
anyone
out
there
other
than
me
who;d
be
willing
to
eliminate
the
vermin
from
the
world?
if
i
don;t
do
it,
then
who
will?
that;s
just
it;
there;s
no
one!
i
can
do
it!
in
fact...
i;m
the
only
one
who
can!
i;ll
do
it.
using
the
death
note,
i;ll
change
the

scum.
and
that
old
creep
thinks
he
can
tame
me?
we
shall
see,
my
friend.
i
only
give
people
what
they
have
coming
to
them.
you
know
i;m
just
a
fool
who;s
willing
to
sit
around
and
wait
for

but
baby,
can;t
you
see
there;s
nothing
else
for
me
to
do?
i;m
hopelessly
devoted
to
you.
don;t
you
know
what
it
means
to
me

ever
since
i

to

i

to
go

i;ll

in
the

i
love
boxing.
it;s
certainly
quite
a
world
apart
from
the
bright

you
talk
about,
but
that
burning
sense
of
worth
and
completeness
is
something
i;ve
only
tasted
on
a
bloodied
ring.
and
this
burning
sensation
isn;t
a
momentary
sputter
that
others

go
through.
it;s
so
intense

it

i;ve
never
felt
anything
like
this
before
i
started

so
you
see,
i;m
not
fighting
on
a
sense
of

alone.
i
fight
because
i
love
to
fight.

achieving
top
performance
in
a
programming
contest
or
any
other
sporting
event
is
not
purely
a
function
of

it
is
important
to
know
the
competition,
to
train
correctly,
and
to
develop
the
proper
strategies
and
tactics
in
order
to
compete
successfully.

and
never

in

have
been
primarily

and
mineral

but
even
when
they
have
developed
some
industrial
production,
it
has
usually
been

i

i

i
wouldn;t
know
what

with

i
caught

you
know,
i
just
do

you
know,
they;re

trying

i;m
not
a
schemer.
i
try
to
show
the
schemers
how
pathetic
their
attempts
to
control

really
are.

i
have
seen
more
intelligent
creatures
than
you

on

i
have
seen
better-organised
creatures
than
you
running
round
farmyards
with
their
heads
cut
off.
now
collect
your
things
and
get
out!
i
never
want
to
see
you
or
any
of
your
men
in
my
hotel
again!
let
me
tell
you
something
my
friend.
hope
is
a
dangerous
thing.
hope
can
drive
a
man
insane.
i
would
not
like
them
here
or

i
would
not
like
them
anywhere.
i
do

and
ham.
i
do
not
like
them,
sam-i-am.
take
my
advice
and
live
for
a
long,
long
time.
because
the
maddest
thing
a
man
can
do
in
this
life
is
to
let
himself
die.
the
goal
a
reader
seeks
determines
the
way
he
reads.
the
effectiveness
with
which
he
reads
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
effort
and
skill
he
puts
into
his
reading.
in
general,
the
rule
is:
the
more
effort
the
better,
at
least
in
the
case
of
books
that
are
initially
beyond
our
powers
as
readers
and
are
therefore
capable
of
raising
us
from
a
condition
of
understanding
less
to
one
of
understanding
more.
finally,
the
distinction
between
instruction
and
discovery
(or
between
aided
and
unaided
discovery)
is
important
because
most
of
us,
most
of
the
time,
have
to
read
without
anyone
to
help
us.
reading,
like
unaided
discovery,
is
learning
from
an
absent
teacher.
we
can
only
do
that
successfully
if
we
know
how.
do
you
buy
all
these
books
retail
or
do
you
send
away
for
like
a
shrink
kit
that
comes
with
all
these
volumes
included?
if
there
were
life
after
death,
i
might,
no
matter
when
i
die,
satisfy
most
of
these
deep
curiosities
and
longings.
but
if
death
is
nothing
more
than
an
endless
dreamless
sleep,
this
is
a
forlorn
hope.
maybe
this
perspective
has
given
me
a
little
extra
motivation
to
stay
alive.
the
world
is
so
exquisite,
with
so
much
love
and
moral
depth,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
deceive
ourselves
with
pretty
stories
for
which
there;s
little
good
evidence.
far
better,
it
seems
to
me,
in
our
vulnerability,
is
to
look
death
in
the
eye
and
to
be
grateful
every
day
for
the
brief
but
magnificent
opportunity
that
life
provides.
this
great
nation
will
endure
as
it
has
endured,
will
revive
and
will
prosper.
so,
first
of
all,
let
me
assert
my
firm
belief
that
the
only
thing
we
have
to
fear
is
fear
itself
-
nameless,
unreasoning,
unjustified
terror
which
paralyzes
needed
efforts
to
convert
retreat
into
advance.
so
don;t
be
afraid;
your
heart
is
in
me,
and
it;s
racing
so
fast
now.
;cause
everything
we
ever
were
or
ever
will
be
is
shapeless
as
a
changing
cloud.
baby,
don;t
you
know,
all
o;them
tears
gon;
come
and
go.
baby
you
just
gotta
make
up
your
mind
that
every
little
thing
is
gonna
be
alright.
baby,
don;t
you
know,
all
o;them
tears
gon;
come
and
go,
baby
you
just
gotta
make
up
your
mind.
we
decide
it.
who
cares
if
you
disagree?
you
are
not
me.
who
made
you
king
of
anything?
so
you
dare
tell
me
who
to
be?
who
died
and
made
you
king
of
anything?
someone
who
takes
an
undemanding
job
because
it
affords
him
the
time
to
pursue
other
interests
and
activities
is
considered
a
flake.
a
person
who
abandons
a
career
in
order
to
stay
home
and
raise
children
is
considered
not
to
be
living
up
to
his
potential.
as
if
a
job
title
and
salary
are
the
sole
measure
of
human
worth.
you;ll
be
told
in
a
hundred
ways,
some
subtle
and
some
not,
to
keep
climbing
and
never
be
satisfied
with
where
you
are,
who
you
are,
and
what
you;re
doing.
there
are
a
million
ways
to
sell
yourself
out,
and
i
guarantee
you;ll
hear
about
them.
to
invent
your
own
life;s
meaning
is
not
easy,
but
it;s
still
allowed,
and
i
think
you;ll
be
happier
for
the
trouble.
there;s
a
teleportation
grid
that
runs

that;s
how
the
monitor
moves
about
so
quickly.
i
learned
how
to
tap
into
the
grid
when
i
was
in
the
control
center.
unfortunately,
each
jump
requires
a
rather
consequential
expenditure
of
energy.
whenever
i
despair,
i
remember
that
the
way
of
truth
and
love
has
always
won.
there
may
be
tyrants
and
murderers,
and
for
a
time,
they
may
seem
invincible,
but
in
the
end,
they
always
fail.
think
of
it:
always.
i
rejected
those
answers;
instead,
i
chose
something
different.
i
chose
the
impossible.
i
chose
rapture,
a
city
where
the
artist
would
not
fear
the
censor.
where
the
scientist
would
not
be
bound
by
petty
morality.
where
the
great
would
not
be
constrained
by
the
small!
and
with
the
sweat
of
your
brow,
rapture
can
become
your
city
as
well.

all
the

in

from
the
very
beginning
-
from
the
first
moment,
i
may
almost
say
-
of
my
acquaintance
with
you,
your
manners,
impressing
me
with
the
fullest
belief
of
your
arrogance,
your
conceit,
and
your
selfish
disdain
of
the
feelings
of
others,
were
such
as
to
form
the
groundwork
of
disapprobation
on
which
succeeding
events
have
built
so
immovable
a
dislike;
and
i
had
not
known
you
a
month
before
i
felt
that
you
were
the
last
man
in
the
world
whom
i
could
ever
be
prevailed
on
to
marry.
whence
all
this
passion
towards
conformity
anyway?
diversity
is
the
word.

this
conformity
business,
they;ll
end
up
by
forcing
me,
an
invisible
man,
to
become
white,
which
is
not
a
color
but
the
lack
of
one.
must
i
strive
towards
colorlessness?
but
seriously
and
without
snobbery,
think
of
what
the
world
would
lose
if
that
should
happen.
america
is
woven
of
many
strands.
i
would
recognize
them
and
let
it
so
remain.
there
were
several
answers,
none
of
which
would
help.
there
was
no
point
in
assuring
his
terrified
wife
that
joe
van
dorn
was
the
steadiest
of
men
in
a
gunfight,
ever
cool,
alert,
and
deadly.
they
wanted
me
to
build
them
a
bomb
so
i
took
their
plutonium
and
in
turn
gave
them
a
shoddy
bomb
casing
full
of
used
pinball
machine
parts.
come
on!
let;s
get
you
a
radiation
suit.
we
must
prepare
to
reload.
my
name
is
turkish.
funny
name
for
an
englishman,
i
know.
my
parents
to
be
were
on
the
same
plane
when
it
crashed.
that;s
how
they
met.
they
named
me
after
the
name
of
the
plane.
not
many
people
are
named
after
a
plane
crash.
that;s
tommy.
he
tells
people
he
was
named
after
a
gun,
but
i
know
he
was
really
named
after
a
famous
19th
century
ballet
dancer.
no!
fool
that
i
am!
i
should
have
remembered!
those
slippers
will
never
come
off
as
long
as
you;re
alive.
but
that;s
not
what;s
worrying
me.
it;s
how
to
do
it.
these
things
must
be
done
delicately
or
you
hurt
the
spell.
the
general
that
hearkens
to
my
counsel
and
acts
upon
it,
will
conquer
-
let
such
a
one
be
retained
in
command!
the
general
that
hearkens
not
to
my
counsel
nor
acts
upon
it,
will
suffer
defeat
-
let
such
a
one
be
dismissed!
"oh,
i
almost
forgot,"
he
said.
"there;s
a
really
interesting
rock
formation,
right
as
you
enter
the
cave.
i
forget
the
exact
scientific
explanation,
but
there;s
something
odd
about
the
composition
of
the
rock,
so
if
you
spread
your
hand
out
and
touch
it
in
the
right
spot,
you
can
feel
one
patch
of
the
stone
that;s
about
fifteen
degrees
colder
than
the
rest
of
the
rock.
it;s
very
bizarre.
i;ll
show
you
where
to
touch
as
we;re
going
in."
why
does
man
create?
is
it
man;s
purpose
on
earth
to
express
himself,
to
bring
form
to
thought,
and
to
discover
meaning
in
experience?
or
is
it
just
something
to
do
when
he;s
bored?
oh,
and
one
more
thing;
i;ve
stolen
a
nuclear
weapon.
and
if
you
do
not
rid
this
city
of
television
in
two
hours,
i
will
detonate
it.
farewell.
by
the
way,
i;m
well
aware
of
the
irony
of
appearing
on
tv
in
order
to
decry
it,
so
don;t
bother
pointing
that
out.
cheer
up!
;cause
nothing
really
matters
when
you
look
up
into

it;s
a
great
big

there;s
no
need
to
cry.
cheer
up!

and
my
best
friend
said
he
came
from
the

he
traveled
to
the

aboard
a
pink
spaceship,
it;s
hard
for
him
to
hide
behind
those
eyes.
at
the
heart
of
every
legend,
there
is
truth:
a
few
brave
souls
unite
to
save
the
world.
we
can
be
heroes
in
our
own
lives,
every
one
of
us,
if
we
only
have
the
courage
to
try.
our
fates
were
always
intertwined,
but
now
our
worlds
are
joined
as
one.
we
need
to
repair
our
planets,
work
together,
if
we
wish
to
survive.
a
dangerous
secret
is
buried
deep
inside
the
earth.
there
is
more
to
this
planet
than
meets
the
eye.

you;re
often
going

find
an

deficient
in
many
parts
of
his
life
because
he
devotes
eight
hours
a
day
to
it.
well,
that
was
fun,
wasn;t
it
dear,
the
odd
moment
like
that?
it;s
almost
worth
staying
alive
for,

it?
it;s
nice
to

a

it;s
what

is
all
about.

know
-
i
read
it
on
the

of
a

i
must
be
taken
as
i
have
been
made.
the
success
is
not
mine,
the
failure
is
not
mine,
but
the
two
together
make
me.
i;m
the
good
guy.
the

is
on
my

is
me.
i

had
a

for

by
the
time
i
got

fifteen
years
ago,
there
was
a
war.
well,
war;s
broken
out
plenty
of
times
before.
they;ve
tried
to
invade
the
southlands
through
the
northern
valley
time
and
time
again.
luck
was
never
on
their
side,
though,
and
their
victories
didn;t
last
long.
they
didn;t
realize
that
times
had
changed.
facing
one
defeat
after
another,
losing
territory
and
watching
their
nation
dwindle,
they
built
up
their
industrial
strength
to
unprecedented
heights
and
used
it
to
wage
one
final
battle
against
the
world.
that
was
fifteen
years
ago...
ready
are
you?
what
know
you
of
ready?
for
eight
hundred
years
have
i
trained
jedi.
my
own
counsel
will
i
keep
on
who
is
to
be
trained.
a
jedi
must
have
the
deepest
commitment,
the
most
serious
mind.
this
one
a
long
time
have
i
watched.
all
his
life
has
he
looked
away...
to
the
future,
to
the
horizon.
never
his
mind
on
where
he
was.
there
is
another
self,
more
really
"us"
than
"i".
and
if
you
become
aware
of
that
unknown
self
-
the
more
you
become
aware
of
it
-
the
more
you
realize
that
it
is
inseparably
connected
with
everything
there
is.
that
you
are
a
function
of
this
total
galaxy,
bounded
by
the
milky
way,
and
that
furthermore
this
galaxy
is
a
function
of
all
other
galaxies.
and
that
vast
thing
that
you
see
far
off,
far
off,
far
off
with
telescopes,
you
look,
and
look,
and
look.
one
day
you;ll
go
and
wake
up
and
say,
"why,
that;s
me!"
and
in
knowing
that
know,
you
see
that
you;ll
never
die.
i;m
not
blind!
i
know
exactly
who
he
is.
he
is
selfish
and
lazy
and
image-obsessed,
and
he
is
a
bad
friend.
and
he;s
also
clever.
and
he
shoots
incredibly
high,
and
he
may
just
make
it.
but
you
know
what,
even
if
he
doesn;t,
i
would
rather
go
broke
betting
on
my
people
than
get
rich
all
by
myself
on
some
island
like
a
castaway.
show
me
a
man
or
a
woman
alone
and
i;ll
show
you
a
saint.
give
me
two
and
they;ll
fall
in
love.
give
me
three
and
they;ll
invent
the
charming
thing
we
call
;society;.
give
me
four
and
they;ll
build
a
pyramid.
give
me
five
and
they;ll
make
one
an
outcast.
give
me
six
and
they;ll
reinvent
prejudice.
give
me
seven
and
in
seven
years
they;ll
reinvent
warfare.
man
may
have
been
made
in
the
image
of
god,
but
human
society
was
made
in
the
image
of
his
opposite
number,
and
is
always
trying
to
get
back
home.
i;m

according
to
heraclitus,
we
cannot
step
into
the
same
river
twice.
to
put
it
another
way,
an
opportunity
lost
stays
lost
forever.
while
i
agree
with
the
spirit
of
that
saying,
i
have
found
that
there
are
times
when
exceptions
are
granted.
when
elizabeth
returned
from
england
and
her
marriage
had
ended,
the
waters
we
found
ourselves
in
were
as
swimmingly
lovely
as
when
we
first
met.
but
if
time
made
concessions
for
love,
it
made
none
for
death.
despairing,
jonah
trudged
forward.
he
could
see
the
other
kids
snaking
along
the
trail
ahead
of
him,
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
woods.
jonah
had
managed
to
talk
to
only
five
of
them.
even
if
chip
reached
all
the
others,
would
they
believe
him?
what
could
they
do,
anyhow?
for
a
moment
the
last
sunshine
fell
with
romantic
affection
upon
her
glowing
face;
her
voice
compelled
me
forward
breathlessly
as
i
listened
-
then
the
glow
faded,
each
light
deserting
her
with
lingering
regret,
like
children
leaving
a
pleasant
street
at
dusk.
i
always
feel
a
certain
sense
of
reverence
in
libraries,
even
small
city
ones
that
smell
like
homeless
internet
users.

cyanides
possess
a
uniquely
long,
dark
history,
probably
because
they
grow
so
bountifully
around
us.
they
flavor
the

of
the
yew

the
flowers
of
the

she
came
into
a
room;
she
stood,
as
he
had
often
seen
her,
in
a
doorway
with
lots
of
people
round
her.
but
it
was
clarissa
one
remembered.
not
that
she
was
striking;
not
beautiful
at
all;
there
was
nothing
picturesque
about
her;
she
never
said
anything
specially
clever;
there
she
was
however;
there
she
was.
late
in
the
afternoon
of
a
day
in
the
early
part
of
last
december
i
had
ridden
out
from
our
lines
in
ladysmith
towards
a
certain
position
usually
occupied
by
a
boer
outpost,
trusting
by
my
going
out
deliberately
and
unarmed
to
get
one
of
the
men
there
to
have
a
talk,
just
as
one
of
the
lancers
had
a
few
days
previously.
for
some
time
we
had
been
on
short
rations
of
"copy"
as
well
as
food.
i
rode
along
the
edge
of
an
empty
spruit,
into
the
bed
of
which
my
spurs
would
have
propelled
my
horse
in
the
unlikely
event
of
a
shot
being
my
first
greeting.
an
important
distinction
is
that
rich
people
buy
luxuries
last,
while
the
poor
and
middle
class
tend
to
buy
luxuries
first.
the
poor
and
the
middle
class
often
buy
luxury
items
like
big
houses,
diamonds,
furs,
jewelry,
or
boats
because
they
want
to
look
rich.
they
look
rich,
but
in
reality
they
just
get
deeper
in
debt
on
credit.
quite
a
plan
you
boys
cooked
up
here.
quite
a
plan.
i;m
not
sure
what
upsets
me
more
-
that
i
have
four
employees
that
conspired
to
commit
felony
fraud,
or
that
i
have
four
employees
that
are
so
stupid
i
found
out
about
it
within
30
seconds.
hearing
it
out
loud,
the
first
one
seems
worse.
when
chekhov
saw
the
long
winter,
he
saw
a
winter
bleak
and
dark
and
bereft
of
hope.
yet
we
know
that
winter
is
just
another
step
in
the
cycle
of
life.
but
standing
here
among
the
people
of
punxsutawney
and
basking
in
the
warmth
of
their
hearths
and
hearts,
i
couldn;t
imagine
a
better
fate
than
a
long
and
lustrous
winter.
going
home,
going
home,
i;m
just
going
home.
quiet-like,
some
still
day,
i;m
just
going
home.

not

just
close

resounded
quivering
at
the
great
shock
of
his
weight
as
he
went
tumbling
down
in
all
his
armor,
drenched
with
blood
and
brains;
in
equal
halves
his
head
hung
this
and
that
way
from
his
shoulders.
i
looked
at
the
captain.
that
terrible
avenger,
like
an
archangel
of
hatred,
still
watched.
when
it
was
all
over,
he
went
to
his
cabin.
under
his
gallery
of
heroes
i
saw
the
portrait
of
a
woman,
still
young,
with
two
little
children.
he
gazed
on
them
for
a
time,
held
out
his
arms
to
them,
then
kneeling
down
he
wept
bitterly.
four

and
seven
years

to
the
proposition
that

what
an
astonishing
thing
a
book
is.
it;s
a
flat
object
made
from
a
tree
with
flexible
parts
on
which
are
imprinted
lots
of
funny
dark
squiggles.
but
one
glance
at
it
and
you;re
inside
the
mind
of
another
person,
maybe
somebody
dead
for
thousands
of
years.
across
the
millennia,
an
author
is
speaking
clearly
and
silently
inside
your
head,
directly
to
you.
writing
is
perhaps
the
greatest
of
human
inventions,
binding
together
people
who
never
knew
each
other,
citizens
of
distant
epochs.

break
the
shackles
of

a
book
is
proof
that

are
capable
of
working

where
do
you
belong?

has
a
safety
deposit
box
full
of

and
six
passports
and
a
gun?
who
has
a
bank
account
number
in
their

i
come
in
here,
and
the
first
thing
i;m
doing
is
i;m
catching
the
sightlines
and
looking
for
an
exit.
you
claim
there;s
no
hope
left
in
the
world.
but
if
despair
is
contagious
like
you
say...
then
so
is
hope!
i;ll
use
my
own
hope
to
plant
seeds
of
hope
inside
everyone
else!
i;m
free
to
be
whatever
i
choose,
and
i;ll
sing
the
blues
if
i
want.
i;m
free
to
say
whatever
i
like.
if
it;s
wrong
or
right
it;s
alright.
i
got
you,
baby
i
got
you.
until
you;re
used
to
my
face,
and
my
mystery
fades,
i
got
you.
so
baby
love
me,
before
they
all
love
me,
until
you
won;t
love
me,
because
they;ll
all
love
me.
i;ll
be
different,
i
think
i;ll
be
different...
i
hope
i;m
not
different,
and
i
hope
you;ll
still
listen,
but
until
then,
baby
i
got
you.

may
seem
as
trivial
as
ever
to
the
blinder
critics
and
philosophers
of
today
-
but
the
core
of
science
fiction,
its
essence,
the
concept
around
which
it
revolves,
has
become
crucial
to
our
salvation
if
we
are
to
be
saved
at
all.
we;ve
had
vicious
kings
and
we;ve
had
idiot
kings,
but
i
don;t
know
if
we;ve
ever
been
cursed
with
a
vicious
idiot
for
a
king!
i;m
a
great
quitter.
it;s
one
of
the
few
things
i
do
well.
i
come
from
a
long
line
of
quitters.
my
father
was
a
quitter,
my
grandfather
was
a
quitter...
i
was
raised
to
give
up.
enjoy
this
next
test.
i;m
going
to
go
to
the
surface.
it;s
a
beautiful
day
out.
yesterday
i
saw
a
deer.
if
you
solve
this
next
test,
maybe
i;ll
let
you
ride
an
elevator
all
the
way
up
to
the
break
room,
and
i;ll
tell
you
about
the
time
i
saw
a
deer
again.
well,
i;ve
been
afraid
of
changing
;cause
i;ve
built
my
life
around
you.
but
time
makes
you
bolder,
children
get
older,
and
i;m
getting
older
too.
demons
do
not
cry.
are
these
the
tears
of
a
long
dead
child?
demons
do
not
cry,
you
became
a
demon
because
you
couldn;t
cry
anymore
right?
humans
cry,
and
when
their
tears
finally
run
dry;
there;s
nothing
left
but
a
demon
or
a
monster.
and
one
final
prayer
for
death.
so
laugh
demon,
laugh
that
arrogant
laugh
of
yours
and
remember,
i
beat
you
to
it.
so
how
long
will
it
be
then?
how
long
before
you;re
no
longer
cursed
to
walk
the
earth?
so
can
we
be
friends
sweetly
before
the
mystery
ends?
i
love
you
more
than
the
world
can
contain
in
its
ramshackle
head.
there;s

we;re
not
even
supposed
to
have
it,
and
i;ll
tell
you
why:
human
thought
is
so
primitive,
it;s
looked
upon
as
an
infectious
disease
in
some
of
the
better
galaxies.
that
kind
of
makes
you
proud,

it?

i
thought
maybe
i;d

i
figured,
since
i
run
this

maybe
i;d
just

there

an
excitement
in

men
who

difficult

making

life
is
made
up
of

of
small

and
a
small
number

ones.
an
autobiography
must
therefore,
unless
it
is
to
become
tedious,
be
extremely
selective,
discarding
all
the
inconsequential

there
is
a

love
to
see
that.

somewhere
out
there,
all
those

there
might
be
at
this
very
moment
a
space
dad
who
just
got
kicked
out
of
his
space
trailer
who;s
looking
down
on
us.
or
would
it
be
up
at
us?
or
maybe
sideways?
obviously,
if
i
was
serious
about
having
a
relationship
with
someone
long-term,
the
last
people
i
would
introduce
him
to
would
be
my

our
prematurity
brought
a
second
big
advantage:
it
forced
us
to
communicate.
a
newborn
human
is
so
helpless
that
it
cannot
survive
without
communicating
its
needs.
many
babies
died
in
the
past.
but
some
babies
were
better
at
signaling
their
needs,
and
some
mothers
were
better
at
interpreting
the
signals.
babies
who
got
their
needs
met
lived
to
pass
on
their
genes
and
their
mother;s
genes.
we
were
thus
naturally
selected
for
the
ability
to
communicate.
human
madness
is
oftentimes
a
cunning
and
most
feline
thing.
when
you
think
it
fled,
it
may
have
but
become
transfigured
into
some
still
subtler
form.
the
choice
for
mankind
lies
between
freedom
and
happiness
and
for
the
great
bulk
of
mankind,
happiness
is
better.

they

something
deep
inside,
allowing
him
to
grow.
without
change
something
sleeps
inside
us,
and
seldom
awakens.
the
sleeper
must
awaken.
right
now
there
are
three
people

there;s

whenever
you
watch
the
mind,
you
withdraw
consciousness
from
mind
forms,
and
it
then
becomes
what
we
call
the
watcher
or
the
witness.
when
consciousness
frees
itself
from
identification
with
physical
and
mental
forms,
it
becomes
what
we
may
call
pure
or
enlightened
consciousness,
or
presence.

not

i
wanted

i
should
ask

for

that
i

that
i
am
yet
to
do,
there
can
be
no
forgiveness.
and
yet
i
think
i;m
not
an
evil
man.
evil
men
pray
louder,
seek
penance,
and
stick
themselves
closer
to
heaven
than
i
am.

shall
not

i
have
seen

it
was
in

and
in
the
morning
all
was
gone.
i
know
myself
for
what
i
am.

i
throw
my
poor
soul
upon
your
forgiveness,
in
the
full
knowledge

of

unsettlingly,
as

if
you

you
might
look
in

mirror
and
find
your
reflection
suspicious,

you
might
cease

that
the

in
your
chest

you
might
think
parts
of
your
body
were
rotting
away.
in
the
most
extreme
cases,
you
might

you;d

are
you
ready
to
do
something
impossible?
you
shake
my
nerves

you
rattle
my

much
love
drives
a

insane;
you
broke
my
will,

what
a
thrill.

the
universe
is
true
for
us
all
and
dissimilar
to
each
of
us.
if
we
were
not
obliged,
to
preserve
the
continuity
of
our
story,
to
confine
ourselves
to
frivolous
reasons,
how
many
more
serious
reasons
would
permit
us
to
demonstrate
the
falsehood
and
flimsiness
of
the
opening
pages
of
this
volume
in
which,
from
my
bed,
i
hear
the
world
awake,
now
to
one
sort
of
weather,
now
to
another.
let
me
ask
you
this:
do
you
really
think
the
boy;d
shout
out
a
thing
like
that
so
the
whole
neighborhood
could
hear
him?
i
don;t
think
so
-
he;s
much
too
bright
for
that.
yet
the
web
of
thought
has
no
such
creases
and
is
more
like
a
weaver;s
masterpieces;
one
step,
a
thousand
threads
arise,
hither
and
thither
shoots
each
shuttle,
the
threads
flow
on,
unseen
and
subtle,
each
blow
effects
a
thousand
ties.
but
i;ve
never
seen
the
icarus
story
as
a
lesson
about
the
limitations
of
humans.
i
see
it
as
a
lesson
about
the
limitations
of
wax
as
an
adhesive.
hello,
hello,
hello,
is
there
anybody
in
there?
just
nod
if
you
can
hear
me.
is
there
anyone
home?
come
on,
come
on,
out,
i
hear
you;re
feeling
down.
i
can
ease
your
pain
and
get
you
on
your
feet
again.
relax,
relax,
relax,
i
need
some
information
first.
just
the
basic
facts,
can
you
show
me
where
it
hurts?
everything
we
hold
dear
likewise
resolves
into
its
original
essence:
values,
principles,
goals,
and
aspirations.
if
we
take
them
seriously,
we
will
suffer
when
they
are
stolen
from
us,
just
as
the
lord
buddha
taught.
but
if
we
see
that
they
are
all
farts
in
the
wind,
and
let
them
fly,
then
we
can
dwell
in
the
original
essence,
which
is
fragrant
and
sweet,
instead
of
the
fart,
which
is
not.
i
know
what
you

to

it;s
just
a

young
fellas
like
yourself
can
wear
a
suit

and
have
a

do
you
really
want
to

he;s
allowed

who
to

the

chosen
based
on
some
kind
of
iq

and
maybe
also
a
physical
tournament,
like
a

and

are
brought
to

maybe...
when
he
desires
them.
it;s
one

another
to

we;re

cruelty
and

and
oppression.
and
where
once
you
had
the
freedom
to
object,
to
think
and
speak
as
you
saw
fit,
you
now
have
censors
and
systems
of
surveillance
coercing
your
conformity
and
soliciting
your
submission.
how
did
this
happen?
who;s
to
blame?
well
certainly
there
are
those
more
responsible
than
others,
and
they
will
be
held
accountable,
but
again
truth
be
told,
if
you;re
looking
for
the

you
need
only
look
into

when
we
pulled
out
into
the
winter
night
and
the
real
snow,
our
snow,
began
to
stretch
out
beside
us
and
twinkle
against
the
windows,
and
the
dim
lights
of
small
wisconsin
stations
moved
by,
a
sharp
wild
brace
came
suddenly
into
the
air.
we
drew
in
deep
breaths
of
it
as
we
walked
back
from
dinner
through
the
cold
vestibules,
unutterably
aware
of
our
identity
with
this
country
for
one
strange
hour,
before
we
melted
indistinguishably
into
it
again.
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
difficult
than
candor,
and
nothing
easier
than
flattery.
if
there
is
a
hundredth
of
a
fraction
of
a
false
note
to
candor,
it
immediately
produces
dissonance,
and
as
a
result,
exposure.
but
in
flattery,
even
if
everything
is
false
down
to
the
last
note,
it
is
still
pleasant,
and
people
will
listen
not
without
pleasure;
with
coarse
pleasure,
perhaps,
but
pleasure
nevertheless.
as
he
spoke
the
gleam
of
the
sidelights
of
a
carriage
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue.
it
was
a
smart
little
landau
which
rattled
up
to
the
door
of
briony
lodge.
as
it
pulled
up,
one
of
the
loafing
men
at
the
corner
dashed
forward
to
open
the
door
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
copper,
but
was
elbowed
away
by
another
loafer,
who
had
rushed
up
with
the
same
intention.
a
fierce
quarrel
broke
out,
which
was
increased
by
the
two
guardsmen,
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
loungers,
and
by
the
scissors-grinder,
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other
side.
the
human
body
consists
of
an
incredibly
complex
system
of
molecules,
cells,
tissues,
organs
and
organ
systems
functioning
together.
ultimately,
the
interaction
of
these
components
provides
humans
with
the
ability
to
achieve
the
highest
levels
of
physical
and
mental
functions,
as
well
as
maintaining
homeostasis.
sociopathy
is
the
inability
to
process
emotional
experience,
including
love
and
caring,
except
when
such
experience
can
be
calculated
as
a
coldly
intellectual
task.
in
politics,
my
dear
fellow,
you
know,
as
well
as
i
do,
there
are
no
men,
but
ideas
-
no
feelings,
but
interests;
in
politics
we
do
not
kill
a
man,
we
only
remove
an
obstacle,
that
is
all.
but
here
we
will
not
try
to
pass
judgment
on
the
objective
value
of
actions;
we
will
be
concerned
instead
with
the
more
modest
task
of
describing
the
subjective
order
that
a
unified
purpose
brings
to
individual
consciousness.
in
this
sense
the
answer
to
the
old
riddle
"what
is
the
meaning
of
life?"
turns
out
to
be
astonishingly
simple.
the
meaning
of
life
is
meaning:
whatever
it
is,
wherever
it
comes
from,
a
unified
purpose
is
what
gives
meaning
to
life.
thirdly,
however,
these
wars
could
now
be
waged
with
the
new
technology
of
capitalism.
since
this
technology,
through
the
camera
and
the
telegraph,
also
transformed
the
reporting
of
war
in
the
press,
it
now
brought
its
reality
more
vividly
before
the
literate
public.

i;ve

the
supreme
question
about
a
work
of
art
is
out
of
how
deep
a
life
does
it
spring.
why
study
science?
science,
more
than
any
other
discipline,
provides
us
with
tools
to
learn
about
the
world.
science
is
not
a
listing
of
facts;
science
is
an
invitation
to
observe
the
world,
ask
questions,
and
puzzle
over
problems
and
enjoy
the
process
of
solving
them.
from
the
time
children
begin
to
perceive
their
environment,
they
are
involved
in
science.

was
never
a
credible
shortcut.

zarathustra

thirty

then
i;m
happy
for

safe
in
the

there
will
always
be
a
bit
of
my
heart
devoted
to

teddy
told
me
that
in
greek,
"nostalgia"
literally
means
the

from
an
old

your
heart,

more

it;s
called

way

it;s
always
difficult
to
keep
personal
prejudice
out
of
a
thing
like
this.
and
wherever
you
run
into

always
obscures
the

don;t

the
truth

i
don;t

may
be
trying

go

don;t

nobody
really
can.
but
we
have
a
reasonable
doubt,

that;s
something
that;s

valuable

with

some
of

have
stood

and

the

how
to

some
of
us,
like
the
characters
on

couldn;t
figure
out
how
to
go
to
the

last
thing
i
remember,
i
was

was

if

what
if

what
if
instead
of
tic
tacs
i
accidentally
pop
a
couple
of

and
i
have
to
keep
punching
my

why,
if
i
had
half
a

i
could

what;s
causing
them,
but
it;s

so,
the

are
called
in
to
solve
the
mystery.
the
world
isn;t

by

anymore,
or

or

it;s
run
by
little

and

it;s
all
just

were
being
treated
like

not
out

out

i
no

to
use
my
skills
to
aid
in

here
i
am,

with
the

there
was
a
stage
and
a
pa
up
in
western

and
the

came
from

messed
up
on

she
drove
down
from
bowdoin
with
a
carload
of
girlfriends,
to
meet
some
boys
and
maybe
eat
some
mushrooms.
and
they
did,
and
she
got
sick,
and
now
she;s
pinned
and
way
too
shaky.
i
can

even
if
i

i
know

that
the
sun
is
there
-
that
is

one
day,
back
in
1896,
i
was
crossing
over
to
jersey
on
the
ferry,
and
as
we
pulled
out,
there
was
another
ferry
pulling
in,
and
on
it
there
was
a
girl
waiting
to
get
off.
a
white
dress
she
had
on.
she
was
carrying
a
white
parasol.
i
only
saw
her
for
one
second.
she
didn;t
see
me
at
all,
but
i;ll
bet
a
month
hasn;t
gone
by
since
that
i
haven;t
thought
of
that
girl.
soon
i;ll
be
sixty
years
old,
my
daddy
got
sixty-one.
remember
life
and
then
your
life
becomes
a
better
one.
i
made
a
man
so
happy
when
i
wrote
a
letter
once.
i
hope
my
children
come
and
visit,
once
or
twice
a
month.

doon
looked
startled
for
a
moment,
and
then
he
took
a
step
toward
her
and
wrapped
his
arms
around
her.
he
gave
her
a
squeeze
so
quick
and
tight
that
it
made
her
cough,
and
then
it
made
her
laugh.

realized

at

doon
-

his

-

i
suffered
no
pain,
my
hunger
had
taken
the
edge
off;
instead
i
felt
pleasantly
empty,
untouched
by
everything
around
me
and
happy
to
be
unseen
by
all.
i
put
my
legs
up
on
the
bench
and
leaned
back,
the
best
way
to
feel
the
true
well-being
of
seclusion.
there
wasn;t
a
cloud
in
my
mind,
nor
did
i
feel
any
discomfort,
and
i
hadn;t
a
single
unfulfilled
desire
or
craving
as
far
as
my
thought
could
reach.
i
lay
with
open
eyes
in
a
state
of
utter
absence
from
myself
and
felt
deliciously
out
of
it.
every
time
i
think
of
exercise,
i
have
to
lie
right
down
until
the
feeling
leaves
me.
oh,
yes.

can
hurt.
but
the
way
i
see
it,
you
can
either
run
from
it...
or

from

on

we

in
cities,
and
now
we;re
going
to
live
on

now,
i;m
going
to
give
you
three
simple
rules.
first,
trust
no
one,
whatever
his
uniform
or
rank,
unless
he
is
known
to
you
personally.
second,
anyone
or
anything
that
approaches
within
200
yards
of
the
perimeter
is
to
be
fired
upon.
third,
if
in
doubt,
shoot
first
then
ask
questions
afterward.
well,
i;m
no
poet,
but
i
can;t
be
fooled.
the
lies
don;t
count,
the
whispers
do.
i
hear
the
whispers
on
the
wind.
they
say
the
earth
has
fallen

in
circles.
our
days
are
numbered.

night

look

and
i
pray.
life
is
to
be
lived,
not
controlled;
and
humanity
is
won
by
continuing
to
play
in
face
of
certain
defeat.
well,
that;s
their
own
stupidity,
i
should
have
been
there.
well,
darkness
is
the
absence
of
light,
and
the
stupidity
in
that
instance
was
the
absence
of
me...

player
in
the

scene.
he
goes
to
the
reservation,
he
drinks
and
gets
mean,
and
he;s
gonna
start
a
war.
he
hops
in
his
pickup,
puts
the
pedal
to

we
love
people
who;ve
died...
where;s
the
social
utility
in
that?
maybe
it
means
something
more
-
something
we
can;t
yet
understand.
maybe
it;s
some
evidence,
some
artifact
of
a
higher
dimension
that
we
can;t
consciously
perceive.
i;m
drawn
across
the
universe
to
someone
i
haven;t
seen
in
a
decade,
who
i
know
is
probably
dead.
love
is
the
one
thing
we;re
capable
of
perceiving
that
transcends
dimensions
of
time
and
space.
maybe
we
should
trust
that,
even
if
we
can;t
understand
it
yet.
for
so
many
years
i
lived
in
constant
terror
of
myself.
doubt
had
married
my
fear
and
moved
into
my
mind,
where
it
built
castles
and
ruled
kingdoms
and
reigned
over
me,
bowing
my
will
to
its
whispers
until
i
was
little
more
than
an
acquiescing
peon,
too
terrified
to
disobey,
too
terrified
to
disagree.
i
had
been
shackled,
a
prisoner
in
my
own
mind.
but
finally,
finally,
i
have
learned
to
break
free.

i
distrust
a
close-mouthed
man.
he
generally
picks
the
wrong
time
to
talk
and
says
the
wrong
things.
talking;s
something
you
can;t
do
judiciously,
unless
you
keep
in
practice.
now,
sir,
we;ll
talk
if
you
like.
i;ll
tell
you
right
out,
i;m
a
man
who
likes
talking
to
a
man
who
likes
to
talk.

i
catch
it
comin;
back
my
way
i;m
gonna
serve
it
to
you.

that
ain;t
what
you
want
to
hear,
but
that;s
what
i;ll
do.

void
of
space
that
folds
and
swallows
-
a
darkness
that
would
devour
anyone
not
as
strong
as

up

i
am
not
wondering
the
things
that
i
might
have

i;m
no

know
why
you

promised
you

through
meticulous

of

i
will
find
a
way
to
make
the

by
studying

i;ll
discover
the

revolutionized
the

convinced,

that

focus
your
attention
on
the
now
and
tell
me
what
problem
you
have
at
this

i
am
not
getting
any
answer
because
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
problem
when
your
attention
is
fully
in
the
now.
do
you
know
i;ve
been
sitting
here
thinking
to
myself:
that
if
i
didn;t
believe
in
life,
if
i
lost
faith
in
the
woman
i
love,
lost
faith
in
the
order
of
things,
were
convinced
in
fact
that
everything
is
a
disorderly,
damnable,
and
perhaps
devil-ridden
chaos,
if
i
were
struck
by
every
horror
of
man;s
disillusionment
-
still
i
should
want
to
live.
although
the
law
of
one
price
holds
for
goods
that
are
nearly
uniform
in
characteristics
and
quality
and
easily
traded
in
nearly
perfectly
competitive
markets,
many
-
if
not
most
-
goods
are
not
like
that.
goods
of
the
same
general
type
may
be
differentiated
in
important
ways:
a
lexus
ls
and
a
ford
focus
are
both
cars,
yet
they
are
very
different
cars,
and
there
is
no
reason
that
their
prices
should
be
identical.
this
is
the
most
stupid,
irresponsible,
dangerous
thing
you
have
ever
done!
is
this
what
you
want?
will
we
have
to
identify
your
charred
little
bodies
through
their
dental
records?
i
want
a
straight
answer!
who
did
this?
things,
events,
that
occupy
space
yet
come
to
an
end
when
someone
dies

us
stop
in
wonder.
this
gentleman
has
been
standing
alone
against
us.
now,
he
doesn;t
say
that
the
boy
is
not
guilty;
he
just
isn;t
sure.
well,
it;s
not
easy
to
stand
alone
against
the
ridicule
of
others,
so
he
gambled
for
support...
and
i
gave
it
to
him.
i
respect
his
motives.
the
boy
is
probably
guilty,
but
-
eh,
i
want
to
hear

there
are
times,
sir,
when

do
you

napalm,
son.
nothing
else
in
the

smells
like
that.
i
love
the
smell
of
napalm
in
the
morning.
you
know,
one
time
we
had
a

for
twelve
hours.

homeless

these
people
bring
no

i
feel
like
moses,
i
feel
like
i;m

and
if
you
ain;t
my
friend
then
your
girl

to
me.
i
don;t
give
a
damn
if
a
guy
said
he
knew
me.
once
i
lived
the
life
of
a
millionaire,
spending
my
money,
i
didn;t
care.
i
carried
my
friends
out
for
a
good
time
buying
bootleg
liquor,
champagne,
and
wine.
then
i
began
to
fall
so
low,
i
didn;t
have
a
friend,
and
no
place
to
go.
so
if
i
ever
get
my
hand
on
a
dollar
again
i;m
gonna
hold
on
to
it
till
them
eagles
grin.
nobody
knows
you
when
you;re
down
and
out.
in
my
pocket,
not
one
penny,
and
my
friends
i
haven;t
any.
but
if
i
ever
get
on
my
feet
again,
then
i;ll
meet
my
long
lost
friend.
it;s
mighty
strange,
without
a
doubt,
nobody
knows
you
when
you;re
down
and
out.
though
i
am
often
in
the
depths
of
misery,
there
is
still
calmness,
pure
harmony
and
music
inside
me.
i
see
paintings
or
drawings
in
the
poorest
cottages,
in
the
dirtiest
corners.
and
my
mind
is
driven
towards
these
things
with
an
irresistible
momentum.
preposterous!
to
think
that
a
human
being
could
be
destroyed
by
an
animal
ten
thousand
times
smaller
than
a
flea.
it;s
as
though
an
army
of
ants
were
to
overthrow
your
majesty;s
empire.
we;re
no
strangers
to
love.
you
know
the
rules
and
so
do
i.
a
full
commitment;s
what
i;m
thinking
of.
you
wouldn;t
get
this
from
any
other
guy.
i
just
wanna
tell
you
how
i;m
feeling.
gotta
make
you
understand.
never
gonna
give
you
up.
never
gonna
let
you
down.
never
gonna
run
around
and
desert
you.
never
gonna
make
you
cry.
never
gonna
say
goodbye.
never
gonna
tell
a
lie
and
hurt
you.
i
know
i;m
supposed
to
help
you,
but
i
can;t.
instead
of
being
your
support
i;m
your
weight.
life
is
very
heavy
to
me,
but
it
is
so
light
to
you.
well,
it;s
one
louder,
isn;t
it?
it;s
not
ten.
you
see,
most
blokes,
you
know,
will
be
playing
at
ten.
you;re
on
ten
here,
all
the
way
up,
all
the
way
up,
all
the
way
up,
you;re
on
ten
on
your
guitar.
where
can
you
go
from
there?
where?
what
do
you
care
what
i
think
anyway?
i
don;t
even
count,
right?
i
could
disappear
forever
and
it
wouldn;t
make
any
difference.
i
might
as
well
not
even
exist
at
this
school,
remember?
i
came
into
this
world
in
the
rough
and
ready
year
of
1923.
it
was
a
barbarous
time,
it
was
a
bleak
time,
and
it
was
an
uncivilized
time.
my
memories
stretch
back
almost
a
hundred
years
and
if
i
close
my
eyes,
i
can
smell
the
poverty
that
oozes
from
the
dusky
tenement
streets
of
my
boyhood.
i
can
taste
on
my
lips
the
bread
and
drippings
that
i
was
served
for
my
tea.
i
can
remember
extreme
hunger
and
my
parents;
undying
love
for
me.
oh,
better
far
to
live
and
die
under
the
brave
black
flag
i
fly,
than
play
a
sanctimonious
part
with
a
pirate
head
and
a
pirate
heart.
away
to
the
cheating
world
go
you,
where
pirates
all
are
well-to-do,
but
i;ll
be
true
to
the
song
i
sing,
and
live
and
die
a
pirate
king.
i
yearn
for
true
gender
equality.
i
have
no
patience
for
one
who
talks
about
female
privilege
when
it
suits
them,
and
then
complains
about
someone
"not
being
a
man"
when
it;s
convenient.
love
is
a
command,
not
just
a
feeling.
somehow,
in
the
romantic
world
of
music
and
theater
we
have
made
love
to
be
what
it
is
not.
we
are
what
we
pretend
to
be,
so
we
must
be
very
careful
what
we
pretend
to
be.
it
takes
something
more
than
intelligence
to
act
intelligently.

do
i

i
often
see
racers,
particularly
at
the
back
of
the
pack
in
amateur
races,
trying
to
go
fast,
with
their
arms
flailing
around,
banging
off
shifts,
jerking
the
steering
into
a
turn
with
feet
stabbing
at
the
pedals
-
the
car
usually
in
massive
slides
through
the
turns.
it
may
feel
fast
and
even
look
fast,
but
i;ll
guarantee
it;s
not.
if
the
driver
would
only
slow
down,
the
car
would
actually
go
faster.

of

and

to

and
yet,
across
the

minds

superior

regarded
this

with
envious

and
surely,
they

to

sometimes
i
wonder,
though:
isn;t
the
way

stare
at

sitting
in

just
as
strange?

where

watch

tearing
apart,

facts
can
be

a
subjective
fact
is
one
that
is
limited

depends
entirely
on
the

now
that
it;s

i
knew
it
then.

with

sicilian

that;s
been
going
on

2,000

it;s
a
sad,
sad
situation,
and
it;s
getting
more
and
more
absurd.
why
can;t
we
talk
it
over?
oh
it
seems
to
me
that
sorry

the
automobile

this,
someone
had
to
remain
in

car
at
all
times,
driving
in
circles
until
passengers
returned
from
their
errands.
i
finally
figured
it
out.
it;s
like
when
they
realized
it
was
gonna
be
too
expensive
to
actually
build
cyborgs
and
robots.
i
mean,
the
costs
of
that
were
impossible.
they
decided
to
just
let
humans
turn
themselves
into
robots.
that;s
what;s
going
on
right
now.
i
mean,
why
not?
there;re
billions
of
us
just
laying
around,
not
really
doing
anything.
we
don;t
cost
anything.
we;re
even
pretty
good

at
three
o;clock
precisely
i
was
at
baker
street,
but
holmes
had
not
yet
returned.
the
landlady
informed
me
that
he
had
left
the
house
shortly
after
eight
o;clock
in
the
morning.
i
sat
down
beside
the
fire,
however,
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
him,
however
long
he
might
be.
i
was
already
deeply
interested
in
his
inquiry,
for,
though
it
was
surrounded
by
none
of
the
grim
and
strange
features
which
were
associated
with
the
two
crimes
which
i
have
already
recorded,
still,
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
exalted
station
of
his
client
gave
it
a
character
of
its
own.
the
pathology
of
setting
a
deadline
to
the
earliest
articulable
date
essentially
guarantees
that
the
schedule
will
be
missed.
even
the
strategy
of
picking
the
"most
likely
date"
is
not
particularly
safe,
as
the
area
to
the
left
of
the
peak
of
the
curve
is
barely
a
third.
that
says
there
is
a
two-thirds
chance
of
missing
the
deadline.

i;m

even

mandrake,
do
you
recall
what
clemenceau
once
said
about
war?
he
said
war
was
too
important
to
be
left
to
the
generals.
when
he
said
that,
50
years
ago,
he
might
have
been
right.
but
today,
war
is
too
important
to
be
left
to
politicians.
they
have
neither
the
time,
the
training,
nor
the
inclination
for
strategic
thought.

long
i
thought
that

i;d
be

i;m

my

talks
to
me,
he
even
thinks
i;m
a

everything
should
be
perfect,
right?
i
should
be
happy
now,
but
i;m
not.
i;m
angrier
than
ever
and
i
don;t
know
why.
if
i;m
laden
at
all,
i;m
laden
with
sadness
that
everyone;s
heart
isn;t
filled
with
the
gladness
of
love
for
one
another.
it;s
disgusting
and
actually
the
only
honourable
course
of

is
for
all

of

go

after
sleeping
through
a
hundred
million
centuries
we
have
finally
opened
our
eyes
on
a
sumptuous
planet,
sparkling
with
color,
bountiful
with
life.
within
decades
we
must
close
our
eyes
again.
isn;t
it
a
noble,
an
enlightened
way
of
spending
our
brief
time
in
the
sun,
to
work
at
understanding
the
universe
and
how
we
have
come
to
wake
up
in
it?
this
is
how
i
answer
when
i
am
asked
-
as
i
am
surprisingly
often
-
why
i
bother
to
get
up
in
the
mornings.
then,
waiting,
i
heard
the
silence
pouring
from
them.
the
audience
held
themselves
quiet,
tense
and
tight,
as
if
the
song
had
burned
them
worse
than
flame.
each
person
held
their
wounded
selves
closely,
clutching
their
pain
as
if
it
were
a
precious
thing.
then
there
was
a
murmur
of
sobs
released
and
sobs
escaping.
a
sigh
of
tears.
a
whisper
of
bodies
slowly
becoming
no
longer
still.
then
the
applause.
a
roar
like
leaping
flame,
like
thunder
after
lightning.
you;ll
remember
me
when
the

it
would
have
been
so
pointless
to
kill
himself
that,
even
if
he
had
wanted
to,
the
pointlessness
would
have
made
him

you;re
here

you;re
not

and
you
have
no

you
know
you
really
need
some
help.
a

couldn;t
even
help
you.
you
need
to
go
to

something.

know
what

you
need
to
get
involved
at
the
university

like
where
freud
studied
and
have
all
those
people
looking
at
you
and
checking
up

yet
one
fine
day,
in
a
fit
of
euphoria,
after
he
had
picked
up
the
telephone
and
taken
an
order
for
bonds
that
had
brought
him
a
fifty
thousand

just
like
that,
this
very
phrase
had
bubbled
up
into
his
brain.
on
wall
street
he
and
a
few
others
had
become
precisely
that
-
masters
of
the
universe.
oh,
you;re
too
late.
there;s
really
nothing
left
to
explore.
all
he
ever
wanted
out
of
life
was
love.
you
see,
he
just
didn;t
have
any
to
give.

held
such
better
days.
days
when
i
still
felt
alive.
we
couldn;t
wait
to
get
outside.
the
world
was
wide,
too
late
to
try.
the
tour
was
over,
we;d
survived.
i
couldn;t
wait
;til
i
got
home
to
pass
the
time
in
my
room
alone.
a
long
time
ago,
i
was
in
burma,
my
friends
and
i
were
working
for
the
local
government.
they
were
trying
to
buy
the
loyalty
of
tribal
leaders
by
bribing
them
with
precious
stones.
but
their
caravans
were
being
raided
in
a
forest
north
of
rangoon
by
a
bandit.
so
we
went
looking
for
the
stones.
but
in
six
months,
we
never
found
anyone
who
traded
with
him.
then,
one
day
i
saw
a
child
playing
with
a
ruby
the
size
of
a
tangerine.
the
bandit
had
been
throwing
them
away.
the
mass
of
men
lead
lives
of
quiet
desperation.
what
is
called
resignation
is
confirmed
desperation.
from
the
desperate
city
you
go
into
the
desperate
country,
and
have
to
console
yourself
with
the
bravery
of
minks
and
muskrats.
a
stereotyped
but
unconscious
despair
is
concealed
even
under
what
are
called
the
games
and
amusements
of
mankind.
there
is
no
play
in
them,
for
this
comes
after
work.
but
it
is
a
characteristic
of
wisdom
not
to
do
desperate
things.
he
was
standing
on
an
impossibly
tall
grey
stone
pillar.
a
dark,
starless
sky
loomed
overhead.
all
around
him
was
nothing
but
an
inky
black
expanse
with
a
strange
purple-toned
haze
permeating
throughout.
he
felt
cold
rough
winds
battering
him,
threatening
to
send
him
tumbling
into
the
abyss
below.
far,
far
below,
he
could
see
an
endless
purple
desert
stretching
out
in
all
directions.
shivering,
he
struggled
to
remember
how
he;d
gotten
here.
here;s
what;s
problematic:
you
don;t
even
know
where
your
boyfriend

so
how
do
you
know
if
he;s
in
trouble
or
not?
he;s
into
heroin,
organized
crime,
he;s
associating
with
some
very
dangerous
people,

to
mention
tony

i
took
a
wrong
turn
on
the
way
to
the
bathroom
and
found
myself
in
a
beautifully
proportioned
room
i
had
never
seen
before,
containing
a
really
rather
magnificent
collection
of
chamberpots.
when
i
went
back
to
investigate
more
closely,
i
discovered
that
the
room
had
vanished.
but
i
must
keep
an
eye
out
for
it.
possibly
it
is
only
accessible
at
five
thirty
in

it

on

looking
for

and
asking

i,

a
long

tried

of

as
they
moved
through

computer.
what
did
they
look

were
the

kept
dreaming

thought
i;d

and
then,
one

one
of
the
common
causes
of
difficulty
in
reading
for
precise,
exact,
and
thorough
understanding
is
proceeding
at
too
rapid
a
pace.
if
a
pupil
has
learned
to
read
quite
rapidly
to
get
the
main
ideas
and
has
tended
to
habituate
this
speed,
he
is
likely
to
adopt
it
in
reading
very
difficult
material
or
in
reading
when
he
wants
to
understand
precisely
and
thoroughly.
when
you;re
being
followed
by
the
police,
it;s
important
to
remember
that
having
cops
around
is
a
problem
for
criminals,
but
it;s
an
even
bigger
problem
for
a
detective
trying
to
remain
inconspicuous
on
a
stakeout.
okay
ben,
why
don;t
you
come
open
some
more
presents,
and
santa,
the
armadillo,
and
i
will
have
a
little
talk
in
the
kitchen.
there;s
a
sentence
i
never
thought
i;d
say.
come,
boy,
see
for
yourself.
from
here,
you
will
witness
the
final
destruction
of
the
alliance
and
the
end
of
your
insignificant
rebellion.
you
want
this,
don;t
you?
the
hate
is
swelling
in
you
now.
take
your
jedi
weapon.
use
it.
i
am
unarmed.
strike
me
down
with
it.
give
in
to
your
anger.
with
each
passing
moment
you
make
yourself
more
my
servant.

know
what
kills
more
police
than
bullets
and
liquor?
boredom.
they
just
can;t
handle
that.
you
keep

you
keep
it
dead
boring.
now
it;s
not
august,
it;s
not
february,
it;s
not
july,
it;s
not
even
september!
i
think
you
know
what
it
is.
and
when
it
comes
around
i
wake
up

i
could
not

them.
neither
could
i
rationalize,
explain
away.
i
could
only
re-experience
with
total
cognizance,
unprotected
by
pretense.
self
delusion
was
impossible,
truth
exposed
in
this
blinding
light.
nothing
as
i
thought

nothing
as
i

only
as
it
had

i;m
telling
it
like
it
is.
get
used
to
it
or
put
this
book
down.
because
this
book
is
for
america;s
heroes.
and
who
are
the
heroes?
the
people
who
bought
this
book.
people
who
borrow
this
book
are
not
heroes.
they
are
no
better
than
welfare
queens

off
the

like
card-carrying

for
the
record,
we;re
not

this

to

i
must
confess,
i;ve
made
a
mess
of
what
should
be
a
small
success.
but
i

at
least
i;ve
tried
my
very
best,
i
guess.
if
he
needs
a
million
acres
to
make
him
feel
rich,
seems
to
me
he
needs
it
;cause
he
feels
awful
poor
inside
hisself,
and
if
he;s
poor
in
hisself,
there
ain;t
no
million
acres
gonna
make
him
feel
rich,
an;
maybe
he;s
disappointed
that
nothin;
he
can
do;ll
make
him
feel
rich.
if
we
were
to
use
this
statement
as
a
varying
symbol
by
which
to
rank
writers
for
clearness,
we
might,
i
think,
get
something
like
the
following:
swift,
macaulay,
and
shaw
would
say
that
andre
was
hanged.
bradley
would
say
that
he
was
killed.
bosanquet
would
say
that
he
died.
kant
would
say
that
his
mortal
existence
achieved
its
termination.
hegel
would
say
that
a
finite
determination
of
infinity
had
been
further
determined
by
its
own
negation.
some
time
ago,
before
the
king
of
hyrule
unified
this
country,
there
was
a
fierce
war
in
our
world.
one
day,
to
escape
from
the
fires
of
the
war,
a
hylian
mother
and
her
baby
boy
entered
this
forbidden
forest.
the
mother
was
gravely
injured.
her
only
choice
was
to
entrust
the
child
to
the
deku
tree,
the
guardian
spirit
of
the
forest.
the
deku
tree
could
sense
that
this
was
a
child
of
destiny,
whose
fate
would
affect
the
entire
world,
so
he
took
him
into
the
forest.
after
the
mother
passed
away,
the
baby
was
raised
as
a
kokiri.
and
now,
finally,
the
day
of
destiny
has
come!
my
father
died
on
this
floor.

there.

who
will
tell
me
that
is
not
murder?
who
will
tell
my
legions,
who
love
caesar
as
i
do,
that
that
is
not
murder?
who
will
speak
against
the

in

say
that
a

three

this
might
lead
you
to
infer
that
in

you
need
to
have
three

represent

whoever

the

i

how
unnecessary
it
might
be.

you
got
close.
closer
than
anybody
else.
i
don;t
know
if
it
was
you
or
your
partner,
but
look.
if
you
still
feel
raw
about
things
when
you
heal
up,
come
see
me.
moreover,
as
i
was
still
in
the
prime
of
life,
it
pleased
me
better
to
be
up
and
doing.
you;re
right,
i
did
lose
a
million
dollars
last
year.
i
expect
to
lose
a
million
dollars
this
year.
i
expect
to
lose
a
million
dollars
next
year.
you
know,
mr.
thatcher,
at
the
rate
of
a
million
dollars
a
year,
i;ll
have
to
close
this
place
in
60
years.
if
we
had
any
nerve
at
all
we
would
make
an
effort
to
really
address
the
wrongs
in
this

righteously.

i;ll

an
ethereal
and
sometimes
cruel
goddess.
in
her
relentless
passing,
she
steals
away
our
youth
and
vitality,
often
in
ways
that
seem
insignificant
until
we
finally
realize
how
much
she
has
taken.
still,
she
is
also
a
generous
deity,
who
offers
to
replace
what
she
has
seized
with
a
deeper
wisdom
and
a
clearer
vision
of
life;s
enigmas.
in
this
sense,
time
can
be
our
most
powerful
ally
-
if
we
are
patient
enough.
there
is
a
difference
between
the

coming
and
residing
within
us
and
us
receiving
the

with
power
that
jesus
spoke
of
-
the
baptism
of
the
holy
spirit.
there
is
no
physical
separation
after
the

so
that
edge

be
ignored
and
we
can

thermal
purposes,

goodbye
to
you
my
trusted
friend,
we;ve
known
each
other
since
we
were
nine
or
ten.
together
we;ve
climbed
hills
and
trees,
learned
of
love
and

my
friend,
it;s

now
that
spring
is

of
me
and
i;ll
be
there.
on
the
sidewalk
across
from
me,
near
the
entrance
to
a
barbecue
joint,
some
people
were
holding
an
old-fashioned
revival
meeting.
the
barbecue
cook,
wearing
a
dirty
white
apron,
his
conked
hair
reddish
and
metallic
in
the
pale
sun,
and
a
cigarette
between
his
lips,
stood
in
the
doorway,
watching
them.
kids
and
older
people
paused
in
their
errands
and
stood
there,
along
with
some
older
men
and
a
couple
of
very
tough-looking
women
who
watched
everything
that
happened
on
the
avenue,
as
though
they
owned
it,
or
were
maybe
owned
by
it.
look
at
me.
i;m
24
and
i;ve
never
done
anything.
i
have
a
worthless
philosophy
degree
that;s
gotten
me
no
further
than
a
dead
end
retail
job
working
for
a
mouth
breather
so
i
can
continue
to
support
my
trailer
park
lifestyle.
do
you
think
i
sit
around
feeling
sorry
for
myself?
we
are
one,
but
we
are
many.
and
from
all
the
lands
on
earth
we
come.
we;ll
share
a
dream
and
sing
with
one
voice.
"i
am,
you
are,
we
are
australian."
and
then
he
calls
me
a
jerk
and
says
the
last
guy
who
thought
he
was
a
jerk
was
dead
now.
so
i
don;t
say
nothing
and
he
says,
"what
do
ya
think
about
that?"
so
i
says,
"well,
that
don;t
sound
like
too
good
a
deal
for
him
then."
always
do
your
best
-
your
best
is
going
to
change
from
moment
to
moment;
it
will
be
different
when
you
are
healthy
as
opposed
to
sick.
under
any
circumstance,
simply
do
your
best,
and
you
will
avoid
self-judgment,
self-abuse
and
regret.
happiness
is
not,
of
course,
guaranteed
even
to
those
who
are
affluent,
successful,
and
well
loved.
but
that
happiness
is
not
the
inevitable
outcome
of
happy
circumstances
does
not
mean
we
can
find
it
by
journeying
inward
to
revise
our
thoughts
and
feelings.
the
threats
we
face
are
real
and
can
be
vanquished
only
by
shaking
off
self-absorption
and
taking
action
in
the

we
will
not
succeed
at
all
these
things,
certainly
not
all
at
once,
but
-
if
i
may
end
with
my
own
personal
secret
of
happiness
-
we
can
have
a
good
time
trying.
did
you
think
i
was
a

to

well

at

these

what

as
an
adult
i
have
often
known
that
peculiar
legacy
time
brings
to
the
traveler:
the
longing
to
seek
out
a
place
a
second
time,
to
find
deliberately
what
we
stumbled
on
once
before,
to
recapture
the
feeling
of
discovery.
sometimes
we
search
out
again
even
a
place
that
was
not
remarkable
itself
-
we
look
for
it
simply
because
we
remember
it.
if
we
do
find
it,
of

everything
is
different.

precisely

unfortunately,
i
didn;t
get
a
good
look
at
him
-
the

he
was
heavy
set.
it
was
really
dark.
i
didn;t

to

i
heard
gunshots
but
i...
i
thought
it
was
kids
with
firecrackers,
and
then
when
two
men
drove
out
in
a
car
i
crouched
down
in
the
ragweed.
when
i
think
of
butts,
i
imagine
the
ancients
in
india
deciding
that
the
knight
should
move
two
squares
over
and
one
up
or
one
up
and
two
over.
i
think
of
the
greeks

egyptians

what
to

occupied

in
the
not
too
distant
future,
next
sunday
ad,
there
was
a
guy
named
joel
not
too
different
from
you
or
me.
he
worked
at
gizmonic
institute,
just
another
face
in
a
red
jumpsuit.
he
did
a
good
job
cleaning
up
the
place
but
his
bosses
didn;t
like
him
so
they
shot
him
into
space.
the
sea
was
angry
that
day,
my
friends
-
like
an
old
man
trying
to
send
back
soup
in
a
deli.
i
got
about
fifty
feet
out
and
suddenly
the
great
beast
appeared
before
me.
i
tell
you
he
was
ten
stories
high
if
he
was
a
foot.
as
if
sensing
my
presence,
he
let
out
a
great
bellow.
i
said,
"easy,
big
fella!"
and
then,
as
i
watched
him
struggling,
i
realized
that
something
was
obstructing
its
breathing.
from
where
i
was
standing,
i
could
see
directly
into
the
eye
of
the
great
fish.

as
the

began
a

some
of
the

began
to
make
strange

with

despite
lacking
the

and
his

desire

stalin
must
have
realized
the
seriousness
of
the
situation.
according
to
eyewitnesses,
he
was
stunned
by
the
outbreak
of

as
zhukov
describes
it,
"during
the
first
day
he
was
not
able
to
really
take
himself

the
shock
to

strong
that
his

his

were
not
always

to

mrs.
dorriman,
suffering
in
her
youth
from
injustice
and
a
want
of
affection,
bore
the
marks
of
both;
nothing
but
her
real
sweetness
of
temper
had
saved
her
from
peevishness,
for
fretfulness
is
as
much
the
result
of
perpetual
repression
in
one
feeble
by
nature,
as
violence
and
anger
is
the
outcome
of
an
unchecked
temper
in

the

of
the

-
the

purpose
within
-
can
understand
the
grief
of
one
who
falls
from
that

into
the

struggle
with
worldly
annoyances.

the
science

the

breaking
it
down,
then
reconstructing
it
as
something
else.
it
can
even
make
gold
from

but
alchemy
is
a
science,
so
it
must
follow
the
natural
laws:
to
create,
something
of
equal
value
must
be
lost.
this
is
the
principle
of
equivalent
exchange.
but
on
that
night,
i
learned
the
value
of
some
things
can;t
be
measured
on
a
simple
scale.
my
brother
and
i
knew
the
laws
of
science,
of
equivalent
exchange,
that
gain
required
sacrifice,
that
something
had
to
be
taken
from
us.
but
we
thought
there
was
nothing
more
we
could
lose,
we
were
wrong.
although

i
started
to
walk
down
the
street
when
i
heard
a
voice
saying,
"good

mr.

i
turned,
and
there
was
this
big
white
rabbit
leaning
against
a
lamp-post.
well,
i
thought
nothing
of
that,
because
when
you;ve
lived
in
a
town
as
long
as
i;ve
lived
in
this
one,
you
get
used
to
the
fact
that

naturally,
i
went

to

with

you,

you

you;re

there
was
but
one
question
he
left
unasked,
and
it
vibrated
between
his
lines:
if
gross
miscalculations
of
a
person;s
value
could
occur
on
a
baseball
field,
before
a
live
audience
of
thirty
thousand,
and
a
television
audience
of
millions
more,
what
did
that
say
about
the
measurement
of
performance
in
other
lines
of

could
be

or

is
to

that

you

he
uh...
he
gets
down
to
the

he
looks
back
and
decides
that
all
those

he

the

they

his

is
the
nature
of
a

remain
motionless

to
move

so
cynical?
in
my
opinion,
if,
as
the
result
of
certain
combinations,
kepler;s
or
newton;s
discoveries
could
become
known
to
people
in
no
other
way
than
by
sacrificing
the
lives
of
one,
or
ten,
or
a
hundred
or
more
people
who
were
hindering
the
discovery,
or
standing
as
an
obstacle
in
its
path,
then
newton
would
have
the
right,
and
it
would
even
be
his
duty
to
remove
those
ten
or
a
hundred
people,
in
order
to
make
his
discoveries
known
to
mankind.
it
by
no
means
follows
from
this,
incidentally,
that
newton
should
have
the
right
to
kill
anyone
he
pleases,
whomever
happens
along,
or
to
steal
from
the
market

day.
and
what
haunts
me,
is
that

the

discover

kinship,
no

no

me,

is
no

life
has
become
more
complex
in
the
overwhelming

of

and
life,
when
organized
into

relies
upon
genes
to
be
its
memory
system.
so,
man
is
an
individual
only
because
of
his
intangible
memory...
and
memory
cannot
be
defined,
but
it
defines
mankind.
the
advent
of
computers,
and
the
subsequent
accumulation
of
incalculable
data
has
given
rise
to
a
new
system
of
memory
and

parallel
to
your

humanity
has
underestimated
the
consequences
of
computerization.

you;re

the
feeling

generally
unbearable
to
us
-
when

hungry,
to
be
overt
with
your
power

have
to
seem
fair

we
need
to
be
subtle
-
congenial

cunning,
democratic

not
the

our
little
group
has
always
been
and
always
will
until
the
end.
i
walked
by
your
guidance
counselor;s
office
one
time.
a
bunch
of
you
were
sitting
there
waiting
to
be
shepherded.
i
remember
it
smelled
like
dead
flowers,
like
decay.
then
it
hit
me.
the
hope
of
our
nation;s
future
is

one
morning
i
shot
an
elephant
in
my

he
got
in

pajamas,
i
don;t

no

how
many
men
you
kill,
you
can;t

your
successor.
the
rotten
tiles
broke
with
a
noise
of
disaster
and
the
man
barely
had
time
to
let
out
a
cry
of
terror
as
he
cracked
his
skull
and
was
killed
outright
on
the
cement
floor.
the
foreigners
who
heard
the
noise
in
the
dining
room
and
hastened
to
remove
the
body
noticed
the
suffocating
odour
of
remedios
the
beauty
on
his
skin.
it
was
so
deep
in
his
body
that
the
cracks
in
his
skull
did
not
give
off
blood
but
an
amber-colored
oil
that
was
impregnated
with
that
secret
perfume,
and
then
they
understood
that
the
smell
of
remedios
the
beauty
kept
on
torturing
the
men
beyond
death,
right
down
to
the
dust
of
their
bones.

it

as
though

reveals

many
typists
have
not
memorized
the

usually
each
key
is
labeled,
so
nontypists
can
hunt

letter

relying
on

and
minimizing
the
time
required
for

the
problem
is
that
such
typing
is
slow
and
difficult.

led
them
in
a

a

long
as
he
remained

the

we;ve
come
up
with
a
camera
so
tiny
it
fits
into
this
oversized
novelty
hat.
now,
go
get
us
some
incriminating
footage.
and
remember:
you
have
to
get
in
and
out
in
10
minutes,
or
you
suffer
permanent
neck
damage.
well,
the
time
has
come
to
say,
is
dehumanization
such
a
bad
word?
because
good
or
bad,
that;s
what
is
so.
the
whole
world
is
becoming
humanoid
-
creatures
that
look
human
but
aren;t.
the
whole
world,
not
just
us.
we;re
just
the
most
advanced
country
so
we;re
getting
there
first.
the
whole
world;s
people
are
becoming
mass-produced,
programmed,
numbered,
insensate
things.
i
am
a
world
before
i
am
a
man.
i
was
a
creature
before
i
could
stand.
i
will
remember
before
i
forget.
before
i
forget
that!
get
your
lies
prepared,
you;re
next
in
line
for
judgment
day.
now
aren;t
you
praying,
aren;t
you
begging
that
you;re
anyone
else?
every
time
people
try
to
punish
the
rich,
the
rich
don;t
simply
comply.
they
react.
they
have
the
money,
power,
and
intent
to
change
things.
they
don;t
just
sit
there
and
voluntarily
pay
more
taxes.
instead,
they
search
for
ways
to
minimize
their
tax
burden.
they
hire
smart
attorneys
and
accountants,
and
persuade
politicians
to
change
laws
or
create
legal
loopholes.
they
use
their
resources
to
effect
change.
now
the
scandal
and
the
light
are
to
be
distributed
differently;
it
is
the
conviction
itself
that
marks
the
offender
with
the
unequivocally
negative
sign:
the
publicity
has
shifted
to
the
trial,
and
to
the
sentence;
the
execution
itself
is
like
an
additional
shame
that
justice
is
ashamed
to
impose
on
the
condemned
man;
so
it
keeps
its
distance
from
the
act,
tending
always
to
entrust
it
to
others,
under
the
seal
of
secrecy.
i
am
invisible,
understand,
simply
because
people
refuse
to
see
me.
like
the
bodiless
heads
you
see
sometimes
in
circus
sideshows,
it
is
as
though
i
have
been
surrounded
by
mirrors
of
hard,
distorting
glass.
when
they
approach
me
they
see
only
my
surroundings,
themselves
or
figments
of
their
imagination,
indeed,
everything
and
anything
except
me.
i
don;t
think
i;ve
ever
been
to
an
appointment
in
my
life
where
i
wanted
the
other
guy
to
show
up.
i
was
stealing
saltshakers
again.
ten,
sometimes
twelve
a
night,
shoving
them
in
my
pockets,
hiding
them
up
my
sleeves,
smuggling
them
out
of
bars
and
diners
and
anywhere
else
i
could
find
them.
in
the
morning,
wherever
i
woke
up,
i
was
always
covered
in
salt.
i
was
cured
meat.
i
had
become
beef
jerky.
even
as
a
small,
small
child,
i
knew
it
would
one
day
come
to
this.
but
then
i
find
myself
in
bed,
lost
inside
my
head
again,
running
over
everything,
the
voices,
they
are
deafening.
out
from
the
noise,
i
hear
that
familiar
voice,
he
says
"life
is
the
great
unknown."
since
the
infancy
of
computers,
hackers
have
been
creatively
solving
problems.
in
the
late
1950s,
the
mit
model
railroad
club
was
given
a
donation
of
parts,
mostly
old
telephone
equipment.
the
club;s
members
used
this
equipment
to
rig
up
a
complex
system
that
allowed
multiple
operators
to
control
different
parts
of
the
track
by
dialing
in
to
the
appropriate
sections.
they
called
this
new
and
inventive
use
of
telephone
equipment
hacking;
many
people
consider
this
group
to
be
the
original
hackers.
since
you;ve
gone
i;ve
been
lost
without
a
trace.
i
dream
at
night,
i
can
only
see
your
face.
i
look
around
but
it;s
you
i
can;t
replace.
everyone
said
i
was
daft
to
build
a
castle
on
a
swamp,
but
i
built
it
all
the
same,
just
to
show
them.
it
sank
into
the
swamp.
so
i
built
a
second
one.
that
sank
into
the
swamp.
so
i
built
a
third.
that
burned
down,
fell
over,
then
sank
into
the
swamp.
but
the
fourth
one
stayed
up.
and
that;s
what
you;re
going
to
get,
lad,
the
strongest
castle
in
all
of
england.
they;re
pills
that
create
a
sort
of
temporary
forgettingness.
so
if
somebody
finds
out
how
you
do
a
trick,
you
just
give
;em
one
of
these,
and
they
forget
the
whole
thing.
it;s
a
mainstay
of
the
magician;s
toolkit,
like
how
clowns

the
view
that
machines
cannot
give
rise
to
surprises
is
due,
i
believe,
to
a
fallacy
to
which
philosophers
and
mathematicians
are
particularly
subject.
this
is
the
assumption
that
as
soon
as
a
fact
is
presented
to
a
mind
all
consequences
of
that
fact
spring
into
the
mind
simultaneously
with
it.
it
is
a
very
useful
assumption
under
many
circumstances,
but
one
too
easily
forgets
that
it
is
false.
a
natural
consequence
of
doing
so
is
that
one
then
assumes
that
there
is
no
virtue
in
the
mere
working
out
of
consequences
from
data
and
general
principles.
i
never

wanna
thank

studies
suggest
that
the
influence
of
parents
is
due
to
two
factors:
communication
and
receptivity.
parents
communicate
their
feelings
and
preferences
to
children
constantly.

such
a

and

a
twitching

of

a
metaphysical
jump

a
dancing
thread
of
discombobulation,
the
mustache
is
a
seismograph
of
hector;s
inner
states,
and
not
only
does
it
make
you
laugh,
it
tells
you
what
hector
is
thinking,
actually
allows
you
into
the
machinery
of
his
thoughts.
other
elements
are
involved
-
the

the

the
finely
calibrated

-
but
the
mustache
is
the
instrument
of
communication,
and
even
though
it
speaks
a
language
without
words,
its
wriggles
and
flutters
are
as
clear
and
comprehensible
as

many
different
interpretations
of
the
word
yoga
have
been
handed
down
over
the
centuries.
one
of
these
is
"to
come
together,"
"to
unite."
another
meaning
of
the
word
yoga
is
"to
tie
the
strands
of
the
mind
together."
these
two
definitions
may
at
first
glance
seem
very
different,
but
really
they
are
speaking
about
the
same
thing.
while
"coming
together"
gives
us
a
physical
interpretation
of
the
word
yoga,
an
example
of
tying
the
strands
of
the
mind
together
is
the
direction
of
our
thoughts
toward
the
yoga
session
before
we
take
on
an
actual
practice.
once
those
mental
strands
come
together
to
form
an
intention,
we
are

to
begin

the

emphasizes
the
elements
from
which
music
is
composed.
one
such
structure
is
the
melody,
which
is
a
grouping
of
musical
notes
that
combine
into
a
basic,

flexible
structure.
another
is
the
chord,
which
is
two
or
more
notes
played
simultaneously
to
create

harmony.

to

is
to

so
quick

discernment
is

a
hand

with
finely-ordered
variety

the
chords

knowledge
passes

and
the
shifting
spaces
that
connect
me
to
my
previous
life
as
a
high
school
english
teacher
in
a
small
eastern
city.
this
is
a
particularly
auspicious
occasion
for
us
this
evening,
as
we
have
been
told
that
her
majesty
the
queen
will
be
watching
part
of
this
show
tonight.
now,
we
don;t
know
exactly
when
her
majesty
will
be
tuning
in.
we
understand
that
at
the
moment
she
is
watching
the
virginian,
but
we
have
been
promised
that
we
will
be
informed
the
moment
that
she
changes
the
channel.
her
majesty
would
like
everyone
to
behave
quite
normally,
but
her
equerry
has
asked
me
to
request
all
of
you
at
home
to
stand
when
the
great
moment
arrives,
although
we
here
in
the
studio
will
be
carrying
on
with
our
humorous
vignettes
and
spoofs
in
the
ordinary
way.
earth,
like
most
planets,
has
strong
temperature
gradients,
as
illustrated
by
the
accumulation
of
ice
at
the
poles.
modifying
this
latitudinal
temperature
gradient
are
other
factors
such
as
winds,
mountains
and
large
water
bodies.
all
of
these
factors
also
influence
precipitation
patterns.
my
dear
young
man,
don;t
take
it
too
hard.
your
work
is
ingenious.
it;s
quality
work.
and
there
are
simply
too
many
notes,
that;s
all.
just
cut
a
few
and
it;ll
be
perfect.
-
which
few
did
you
have
in
mind,
majesty?
he
canceled
all
his
commitments
and
pulled
together
the
most
important
of
his
books,
and
now
here
he
was
sitting
inside
a
dusty,
smelly
warehouse.
outside,
a
huge
caravan
was
being
prepared
for
a
crossing
of
the
sahara,
and
was
scheduled
to
pass
through
al-fayoum.
don;t
carry
the
world
upon
your
shoulders,
for
well
you
know
that
it;s
a
fool
who
plays
it
cool
by
making
his
world
a
little
colder.
well,
i;ve
been
to
one
world
fair,
a
picnic,
and
a
rodeo,
and
that;s
the
stupidest
thing
i
ever
heard
come
over
a
set
of
earphones.
you
sure
you
got
today;s
codes?
jay
made
up
for
the
lack
of
glamour
in
his
assignment
by
having
a
romance
with
a
local
miller;s
daughter,
which
he
initiated
by
letting
air
out
of
her
bicycle
tires.
he
also
earned
himself
a
promotion
to
lieutenant
on
the
strength
of
his
commonsense
suggestion
that
the
army
could
save
lots
of
cargo
space
by
deboning
beef
before
shipping
it
overseas.
it
is
always
painful
to
part
from
people
whom
one
has
known
for
a
very
brief
space
of
time.
the
absence
of
old
friends
one
can
endure
with
equanimity.
but
even
a
momentary
separation
from
anyone
to
whom
one
has
just
been
introduced
is
almost
unbearable.
maybe
he
is
different
but
that
doesn;t
mean
that
he;s
guilty.
but
that;s
what
it
means
when
you;re
different.
nobody
trusts
you.
you;re
always
the
first
to
be
blamed.
and
it;s
always
always
your
fault.
droll
thing
life
is
-
that
mysterious
arrangement
of
merciless
logic
for
a
futile
purpose.
the
most
you
can
hope
from
it
is
some
knowledge
of
yourself
-
that
comes
too
late
-
a
crop
of
inextinguishable
regrets.
i
denounce
because
though
implicated
and
partially
responsible,
i
have
been
hurt
to
the
point
of
abysmal
pain,
hurt
to
the
point
of
invisibility.
and
i
defend
because
in
spite
of
it
all,
i
find
that
i
love.
here
in
town
there;s
only
she
who
is
beautiful
as
me,
so
i;m
making
plans
to
woo
and

lenin
believed
that
the
time
to
revolt
and
seize
power
had
come.
again
he
encountered
opposition
within
the
party
to
his
call
for
armed
insurrection,
most
prominently
kamenev
and
zinoviev.
most
of
the
other
party
leaders,
including
stalin,
supported
him.
that;s
because
only
a
real
artist
knows
the
actual
anatomy
of
the
terrible
or
the
physiology
of
fear
-
the
exact
sort
of
lines
and
proportions
that
connect
up
with
latent
instincts
or
hereditary
memories
of
fright,
and
the
proper
color
contrasts
and
lighting
effects
to
stir
the
dormant
sense
of
strangeness.
a
long,
long
time
ago.
i
can
still
remember
how
that
music
used
to
make
me
smile.
and
i
knew
if
i
had
my
chance,
that
i
could
make
those
people
dance,
and
maybe
they;d
be
happy
for
a
while.
but
february
made
me
shiver,
with
every
paper
i;d
deliver.
bad
news
on
the
doorstep,
i
couldn;t
take
one
more
step.
i
can;t
remember
if
i
cried
when
i
read
about
his
widowed
bride,
but
something
touched
me
deep
inside,
the
day
the
music
died.
so
bye-bye,

today,
raisins
have
no
seeds.
when
we
pop
a
raisin
into
our
mouth,
we
are
saved
that
moment
of
nervous
anticipation
we
encounter
with
table
grapes,
wondering
whether
we
are
about
to
bite
into
a
hard
pip.
more
than
90
percent
of
all
raisins
are
made
from
thompson
seedless
grapes,
exactly
the
same
table
grape
that
is
omnipresent
in
produce
sections
of
the
supermarket.
what
distinguished
ellington
from
most
of
his
contemporaries
was
that
he
set
himself
the
goal
of
expanding
the
time
frame
of
the
jazz
piece,
stretching
it
well
beyond
the
limits
of
the
78-rpm
side
and
into
the
realm
of
the
large-scale
classical
work.
hank,
if
you
had
the
power
to
put
companies
out
of
business
by
just
not
being
a
customer,
why
am
i
still
able
to
buy
mouthwash?
gardeners
know
how
to
grow
top-notch
crops.
they
determine
which
plants
thrive
best
under
available
conditions,
plan
their
optimum
placement,
and
nourish
the
seeds
with
plant
food
and
water.
plants
that
receive
the
most
attention
thrive,
blossoming
into
colorful
fruits
and
flowers.
oh,
that
is
convenient
for
you.
you;re
a
fine
looking
fellow,
aren;t
you?
your
square
jaw,
your
golden
armour.
tell
me
-
i
want
to
know,
i
truly
do
-
how
do
you
live
with
yourself?
all
of
us
have
to
believe
that
we;re
decent,
don;t
we?
to
let
us
sleep
at
night.
how
do
you
tell
yourself
that
you;re
decent,
after
everything
that
you;ve
done?
giants

in
the

lightning
in
the

it;s
einstein
and
darwin
doing

with
the
greek

jocks,
the
apocalypse
is
kinda
cool.
and
if
you;re
needing
something
just
ask,
maybe
father

can
try
to
change

got

yeah
they;re

the
strongest
soldiers
don;t
become
what
they
are
by
acquiring
their
skills
through
training
or
experience,
we
now
know
that
hereditary
factors
are
far
more
crucial
for
creating
superior
soldiers.
ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
is
your
stewardess
speaking.
we
regret
any
inconvenience
the
sudden
cabin
movement
might
have
caused.
this
is
due
to
periodic
air
pockets
we
encountered.
there;s
no
reason
to
become
alarmed
and
we
hope
you
enjoy
the
rest
of
your
flight.
by
the
way,
is
there
anyone
on
board
who
knows
how
to
fly
a
plane?
there
are
things
being
negotiated
now
that
are
going
to
solve
all
of
your
problems
and
answer
all
of
your
questions.
that;s
all
i
can
tell
you
now.
carlo,
you
grew
up
in
nevada.
when
we
make
our
move
there
you;re
going
to
be
my
right
hand
man.
tom
hagen
is
no
longer
consigliari.
he;s
going
to
be
our
lawyer
in
vegas.
that;s
no
reflection
on
tom,
it;s
just
the
way
i
want
it.
besides,
if
i
ever
need
help,
who;s
a
better
consigliari
than
my
father?
and
that;s
it.
is
it
really
not
possible
to
touch
the
gaming
table
without
being
instantly
infected
by
superstition?
when
you
have
eaten
enough
to
meet
your
needs,
your
digestive
system
sends
a
message
to
your
brain.
research
suggests
that
the
brain
does
not
receive
this
satisfaction
signal
until
twenty
minutes
after
you;ve
eaten
enough.
it
seems
like
a
glitch
in
the
system,
and
over-eating
is
the
obvious
consequence.
but
overweight
mammals
do
not
exist
in
nature
because
they
are
soon
eaten
by
predators.
yet
you
have
never
been
there.
you
have
not
seen
what
it
has
become.
i
am
dying,
maximus.
when
a
man
sees
his
end...
he
wants
to
know
there
was
some
purpose
to
his
life.
how
will
the
world
speak
my
name
in
years
to
come?
will
i
be
known
as
the
philosopher?
the
warrior?
the
tyrant...?
or
will
i
be
the
emperor
who
gave
rome
back
her
true
self?
there
was
once
a
dream
that
was
rome.
you
could
only
whisper
it.
anything
more
than
a
whisper
and
it
would
vanish...
it
was
so
fragile.
and
i
fear
that
it
will
not
survive
the
winter.
they
may
have
even
had
a
brief
discussion
about
recovering
my
body,
but
regulations
are
clear.
in
the
event
a
crewman
dies
on
mars,
he
stays
on
mars.
leaving
his
body
behind
reduces
weight
for
the
mav
on
the
trip
back.
that
means
more
disposable
fuel
and
a
larger
margin
of
error
for
the
return
thrust.
no
point
in
giving
that
up
for
sentimentality.
who,
if
i
cried
out,
would
hear
me
among
the
angels;
hierarchies?
and
even
if
one
of
them
pressed
me
suddenly
against
his
heart:
i
would
be
consumed
in
that
overwhelming
existence.
for
beauty
is
nothing
but
the
beginning
of
terror,
which
we
still
are
just
able
to
endure,
and
we
are
so
awed
because
it
serenely
disdains
to
annihilate
us.
the
one
constant
through
all
the
years,
ray,
has
been
baseball.
america
has
rolled
by
like
an
army
of
steamrollers.
it
has
been
erased
like
a
blackboard,
rebuilt,
and
erased
again.
but
baseball
has
marked
the
time.
this
field,
this
game:
it;s
a
part
of
our
past,
ray.
it
reminds
us
of
all
that
once
was
good,
and
it
could
be
again.
oh...
people
will
come,
ray.
people
will
most
definitely
come.
i;ll
keep
searching
deep
within
my
soul
for
all
the
answers.
don;t
wanna
hurt
no
more.
i
need
peace,
gotta
feel
at
ease.
need
to
be
free
from
pain,
going
insane.
my
heart
aches,
yeah.
why,
anybody
can
have
a
brain.
that;s
a
very
mediocre
commodity.
every
pusillanimous
creature
that
crawls
on
the
earth
or
slinks
through
slimy
seas
has
a
brain.
back
where
i
come
from,
we
have
universities,
seats
of
great
learning,
where
men
go
to
become
great
thinkers.
and
when
they
come
out,
they
think
deep
thoughts
and
with
no
more
brains
than
you
have.
but
they
have
one
thing
you
haven;t
got:
a
diploma.
i;ve
never
felt
this
healthy
before.
i;ve
never
wanted
something
rational.
listen
morty,
i
hate
to
break
it
to
you,
but
what
people
call
"love"
is
just
a
chemical
reaction
that
compels
animals
to
breed.
it
hits
hard,
morty,
then
it
slowly
fades,
leaving
you
stranded
in
a
failing
marriage.
i
did
it.
your
parents
are
gonna
do
it.
break
the
cycle,
morty.
rise
above.
focus
on
science.
i
didn;t
tell
mama
anything.
i
was
just
about
to
come
up
and
wake
you
so
that
i
could
tell
you.
mr.
van
doren,
i;m
also
from
new
york,
a
different
part
of
new
york.
i;m
happy
that
you
made
the
statement
but
i
cannot
agree
with
most
of
my
colleagues.
you
see,
i
don;t
think
an
adult
of
your
intelligence
ought
to
be
commended
for
simply,
at
long
last,
telling
the
truth.
because
some
roads
you
shouldn;t
go
down.
because
maps
used
to
say,
"there
be
dragons
here."
now
they
don;t.
but
that
don;t
mean
the
dragons
aren;t
there.
oh
yes,
the
past
can
hurt.
but
you
can
either
run
from
it,
or
learn
from
it.
books
are
not
absolutely
dead
things,
but
do
contain
a
potency
of
life
in
them
to
be
as
active
as
that
soul
was
whose
progeny
they
are;
nay,
they
do
preserve
as
in
a
vial
the
purest
efficacy
and
extraction
of
that
living
intellect
that
bred
them.
i
know
they
are
as
lively,
and
as
vigorously
productive,
as
those
fabulous
dragon;s
teeth;
and
being
sown
up
and
down,
may
chance
to
spring
up
armed
men.
and
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
unless
wariness
be
used,
as
good
almost
kill
a
man
as
kill
a
good
book.
who
kills
a
man
kills
a
reasonable
creature,
god;s
image;
but
he
who
destroys
a
good
book,
kills
reason
itself,
kills
the
image
of
god,
as
it
were
in
the
eye.
many
a
man
lives
a
burden
to
the
earth;
but
a
good
book
is
the
precious
life-blood
of
a
master
spirit,
embalmed
and
treasured
up
on
purpose
to
a
life
beyond
life.
see,
the
sad
thing
about
a
guy
like
you
is
in
50
years
you;re
gonna
start
doin;
some
thinkin;
on
your
own
and
you;re
going
to
come
up
with
the
fact
that
there
are
two
certainties
in
life:
one,
don;t
do
that,
and
two,
you
dropped
150
grand
on
an
education
you
could
have
got
for
$1.50
in
late
charges
at
the
public
library!
this
cosmic
dance
of
bursting
decadence
and
withheld
permissions,
twists
all
our
arms
collectively.
but,
if
sweetness
can
win,
and
it
can,
then
i;ll
still
be
here
tomorrow
to
high
five
you
yesterday,
my
friend.
peace.
water.
earth.
fire.
air.
long
ago
the
four
nations
lived
together
in
harmony.
then,
everything
changed
when
the
fire
nation
attacked.
only
the
avatar,
master
of
all
four
elements,
could
stop
them,
but
when
the
world
needed
him
most,
he
vanished.
a
hundred
years
passed
and
my
brother
and
i
discovered
the
new
avatar,
an
airbender
named
aang.
and
although
his
airbending
skills
are
great,
he
has
a
lot
to
learn
before
he;s
ready
to
save
anyone.
but
i
believe
aang
can
save
the
world.
she;s
safe,
just
like
i
promised.
she;s
all
set
to
marry
norrington,
just
like
she
promised.
and
you
get
to
die
for
her,
just
like
you
promised.
so
we;re
all
men
of
our
word
really...
except
for,
of
course,
elizabeth,
who
is
in
fact
a
woman.
for
you,
the
day
bison
graced
your
village,
was
the
most
important
day
in
your
life.
but
for
me,
it
was
tuesday.
the
observed
brightness
of
a
lambertian
surface
may
be
written
as
the
product
of
an
albedo
factor,
p,
and
the
cosine
of
the
incident
angle,
cos
i.
this
means
that
brightness
can
be
written
as
a
product
of
a
term
that
depends
on
the
material,
p,
and
a
term
that
depends
on
surface
direction,
which
in
turn
depends
on
f
and
g.
look,
a
guy
who
builds
a
nice
chair
doesn;t
owe
money
to
everyone
who
ever
has
built
a
chair,
okay?
they
came
to
me
with
an
idea,
i
had
a
better
one.
well,
hey,
i
didn;t
spend
all
those
years
playing
dungeons
and
dragons
and
not
learn
a
little
something
about
courage.
the
darker
the
night,
the
brighter
the
stars,
the
deeper
the
grief,
the
closer
is
god.
i;ve
heard
there
was
a
secret
chord
that
david
played,
and
it
pleased
the
lord,
but
you
don;t
really
care
for
music,
do
you?
it
goes
like
this:
the
fourth,
the
fifth,

we

of

who
have
chosen
to
join

here
in

we
certainly
hope

and
remember,
people,
that
no

who
you

what

there;s
still
some

that

there
are
many
other
ways
of
programming
the
switching

which
will
not
be

here.
in
many
cases
the

sequence
is
under
computer
control.
in
the
simple
method
used
above,
the
intention
is
to
show
the
fundamental
principle
upon
which
pulse
width
modulation
is
used.
by
that
point,
entire
sectors
of
my
cerebral
cortex
seemed
to
have
shut
down
altogether.
dizzy,
fearing
that
i
would
black
out,
i
was
frantic
to
reach
the
south
summit,
where
my
third
bottle
was
waiting.
neal
was
a
felon.
he
was
convicted
on
bond
forgery.
and
as
you
can
see
in
those
files,
he
was
suspected
of
doing
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
other
things.
yeah,
neal
was
a
pain
in
the
ass.
so
did
somebody
from
that
past
want
him
dead?
maybe.
but
he
also
helped
me
clear
a
93%
conviction
rate,
and
that
makes
enemies
too.
anyway,
anyway,
guys
guys
guys,
come
on.
i;m
in
this
computer,
right.
so
i;m
looking
around,
looking
around,
you
know,
throwing
commands
at
it.
i
don;t
know
where
it
is
or
what
it
does
or
anything.
it;s
like,
it;s
like
choice,
it;s
just
beautiful,
okay.
like
four
hours
i;m
just
messing
around
in
there.
finally
i
figure
out
that
it;s
a
bank.
right,
okay
wait,
okay,
so
it;s
a
bank.
so,
this
morning,
i
look
in
the
paper,
some
cash
machine
in,
like,
bumsville
idaho,
spits
out
seven
hundred
dollars
into
the
middle
of
the

writer;s
block
is
a
good
example
of
a
dispositional
fallacy:
a
description
of
behavior
can;t
also
explain
the
described
behavior.
writer;s
block
is
nothing
more
than
the
behavior
of
not
writing.
saying
that
you
can;t
write
because
of
writer;s
block
is
merely
saying
that
you
can;t
write
because
you
aren;t
writing.
it;s
trivial.
the
cure
of
writer;s
block
-
if
you
can
cure
a
specious
affliction
-
is
writing.

few
of
us
make
any
serious
effort
to
remember
what
we
read.
when
i
read
a
book,
what
do
i
hope
will
stay
with
me
a
year
later?
if
it;s
a
work
of
nonfiction,
the
thesis,
maybe,
if
the
book
has
one.
a
few
savory
details,
perhaps.
if
it;s
fiction,
the
broadest
outline
of
the
plot,
something
about
the
main
characters
(at
least
their
names),
and
an
overall
critical
judgment
about
the
book.
even
these
are
likely
to
fade.
looking
up
at
my
shelves,
at
the
books
that
have
drained
so
many
of
my
waking
hours,
is
always
a
dispiriting
experience.
i
tensed,
waiting
for
the
fury
-
both
his
and
mine
-
but
it
was
only
quiet
and
calm
in
the
darkness
of
his
room.
i
could
almost
taste
the
sweetness
of
reunion
in
the
air,
a
separate
fragrance
from
the
perfume
of
his
breath;
the
emptiness
when
we
were
apart
left
its
own
bitter
aftertaste,
something
i
didn;t
consciously
notice
until
it
was
removed.
we
live
in
the
flicker
-
may
it
last
as
long
as
the
old
earth
keeps
rolling!
if
sugar
is
so
bad,
how
come
jesus
made
it
taste
so
good?
haven;t
i
taught
you
anything?
what
have
i
always
told
you?
never
trust
anything
that
can
think
for
itself
if
you
can;t
see
where
it
keeps
its
brain?
but
do
you
remember
gandalf;s
words:
even
gollum
may
have
something
yet
to
do?
but
for
him,
sam,
i
could
not
have
destroyed
the
ring.
the
quest
would
have
been
in
vain,
even
at
the
bitter
end.
so
let
us
forgive
him!
for
the
quest
is
achieved,
and
now
all
is
over.
i
am
glad
you
are
here
with
me.

at
the
end
of
all
things,
sam.

natural
selection
can
act
only
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
infinitesimally
small
inherited
modifications,
each
profitable
to
the
preserved
being;
and
as
modern
geology
has
almost
banished
such
views
as
the
excavation
of
a
great
valley
by
a
single
diluvial
wave,
so
will
natural
selection,
if
it
be
a
true
principle,
banish
the
belief
of
the
continued
creation
of
new
organic
beings,
or
of
any
great
and
sudden
modification
in
their
structure.
oh,
they
all
did,
sire.
there
they
were
in
the
dark;
the
duke
with
his
dagger,
the
doge
with
his
dart,
and
the
duchess
with
her
dirk.
the
duchess
dove
at
the
duke
just
when
the
duke
dove
at
the
doge.
now
the
duke
ducked,
the
doge
dodged,
and
the
duchess
didn;t.
so
the
duke
got
the
duchess,
the
duchess
got
the
doge,
and
the
doge
got
the
duke!

for
this

(a)

a

impression
on
oneself

and
conversely,
evil

there
are
six
things
i;m
mad
about,
and
i;m
taking
over.
a
vision
i
had
in
my
sleep
last
night
-
as
distinguished
from
a
dream
which
is
mere
sorting
and
cataloging
of
the
day;s
events
by
the
subconscious.
this
was
a
vision,
fresh
and
clear
as
a
mountain
stream
-
the
mind
revealing
itself
to
itself.
in
my
vision,
i
was
on
the
veranda
of
a
vast
estate,
a
palazzo
of
some
fantastic
proportion.
there
seemed
to
emanate
from
it
a
light
from
within
-
this
gleaming
radiant
marble.
i
had
known
this
place.
i
had
in
fact
been
born
and
raised
there.
this
was
my
first
return,
a
reunion
with
the
deepest
wellsprings
of
my
being.
they
knew
they
were
privileged
to
have
these
choices,
but
they
also
knew
the
stakes
were
high.
these
people
were
asking
the
big
questions:
how
do
i
find
meaning
in
my
life?
should
i
have
children?
what
is
the
most
meaningful
way
to
connect
with
other
people?
how
should
i
balance
my
work
life
with
my
personal
life
(and
is
there
a
distinction
anymore)?
if
everybody
minded
their
own
business,
the
world
would
go
around
a
great
deal
faster
than
it
does.
my
son,
from
whence
this
madness,
this
neglect
of
my
commands,
and
those
whom
i
protect?
why
this
unmanly
rage?
recall
to
mind
whom
you
forsake,
what
pledges
leave
behind.
maybe
i;m
foolish,
maybe
i;m
blind
thinking
i
can
see
through
this
and
see
what;s
behind.
got
no
way
to
prove
it,
so
maybe
i;m
blind.
but
i;m
only
human
after
all.
don;t
put
your
blame
on
me.
in
carl
jung;s
opinion,
we
all
have
a
sixth
sense
-
intuition.
when
you
meet
someone
and
you
suddenly
feel
like
you
can;t
live
without
them.
this
could
be
the
memory
of
a
past
love
from
the
collective
unconscious.
or
it
could
just
be
hormones.
the
man
that
i
named
the
giver
passed
along
to
the
boy
knowledge,
history,
memories,
color,
pain,
laughter,
love,
and
truth.
every
time
you
place
a
book
in
the
hands
of
a
child,
you
do
the
same
thing.
it
is
very
risky.
but
each
time
a
child
opens
a
book,
he
pushes
open
the
gate
that
separates
him
from
elsewhere.
it
gives
him
choices.
it
gives
him
freedom.
those
are
magnificent,
wonderfully
unsafe
things.
there;s
bound
to
be
rough
waters
and
i
know
i;ll
take
some
falls,
but
with
the
good
lord
as
my
captain
i
can
make
it
through
them
all.
the
machinery
in
these
canyons

generators

signal
and
allow
it
to
fire

into

the
power
levels
are
enormous.
i
can;t
even
begin
to
calculate
the
pulse;s
range.
just

me
all
the
bacon

wait,
wait,
i;m
worried
what
you
just
heard
was
"give
me
a
lot
of
bacon
and
eggs."
what
i
said
was
"give
me
all
the
bacon
and

you
have."
do
you
understand?
the
more
stupid
one
is,
the
closer
one
is
to
reality.
the
more
stupid
one
is,
the
clearer
one
is.
stupidity
is
brief
and
artless,
while
intelligence
squirms
and
hides
itself.
intelligence
is
unprincipled,
but
stupidity
is
honest
and
straightforward.

it
is
sad
to
think
people
are
no
longer

how
to

not

because,
in
this
supreme
qwerty

era,
the

he

of

is

when
i
get
an

i
start
at

up
in

i
change

you

that
there;s
something

you
don;t

what

but
it;s

the
word
science
is
derived
from
a
latin
verb
meaning
"to
know."
science
is
a
way
of
knowing
-
an
approach
to
understanding
the
natural
world.
it
developed
out
of
our
human
curiosity
about
ourselves,
other
life-forms,
our
planet,
and
the
universe.
striving
to
make
sense
of
our
experiences
seems
to
be
one
of
our
basic
urges.
i
was
working
in
the
lab
late
one
night
when
my
eyes
beheld
an
eerie
sight.
when
my
monster,
from
its
slab,
began
to
rise,
and
suddenly
to
my
surprise
he
did
the
mash,
he
did
the
monster
mash.
and
it;s
a
graveyard
smash.
he
did
the
mash,
it
caught

bright
copper
kettles
and
warm
woolen

these
are
a
few
of
my
favorite
things.

and
crisp
apple

doorbells
and
sleigh

and
schnitzel
with

wild
geese

these
are
a
few
of
my
favorite
things.
for
stenographer
jobs,
employers
prefer
to
hire
high
school
graduates
and
seldom
have
a
preference
among
the
many
different
shorthand
methods.
for
court
reporter
jobs,
however,
employers
prefer
stenotype,
not
only
because
reporters
can
write
faster
using
stenotype,
but
also
because
they
can
feed
stenotype
notes
to
a
computer
for
high-speed
transcription.
the
mystery
of

lies
not
in

in

recursive
descent
takes
a
different
approach
to
locating
instructions.
recursive
descent
focuses
on
the
concept
of
control
flow,
which
determines
whether
an
instruction
should
be
disassembled
or
not
based
on
whether
it
is
referenced
by
another
instruction.
to
understand
recursive
descent,
it
is
helpful
to
classify
instructions
according
to
how
they
affect
the
cpu
instruction
pointer.
human
history,
like
all
great
movements,
was
cyclical,
and
returned
to
the
point
of
beginning.
the
idea
of
indefinite
progress
in
a
right
line
was
a
chimera
of
the
imagination,
with
no
analogue
in
nature.
the
parabola
of
a
comet
was
perhaps
a
yet
better
illustration
of
the
career
of
humanity.
tending
upward
and
sunward
from
the
aphelion
of
barbarism,
the
race
attained
the
perihelion
of
civilization
only
to
plunge
downward
once
more
to
its
nether
goal
in
the
regions
of
chaos.
i
saw
a
little
rocky
point
ahead
of
me,
as
if
made
on
purpose
for
a
war
correspondent.
by
running
across
some
open
ground
i
was
on
to
it.
there
was
good
if
not
ample
cover
on
the
top.
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
angle
made
by
the
line
of
advance
of
the
men
along
the
ridge
and
the
line
of
the
devons;
main
advance,
and
quite
close
to
the
hill.
stretching
away
on
our
left
over
a
level
khaki-colored
sloping
field
(if
i
may
so
call
it)
of
veldt,
were
the
devons
lying
behind
ant-hills,
placed
as
if
on
purpose
to
give
scant
but
welcome
shelter
to
troops
advancing
under
fire.
i
saw
something
moving
round
the
foot
of
the
bed,
which
at
first
i
could
not
accurately
distinguish.
but
i
soon
saw
that
it
was
a
sooty-black
animal
that
resembled
a
monstrous
cat.
it
appeared
to
me
about
four
or
five
feet
long
for
it
measured
fully
the
length
of
the
hearthrug
as
it
passed
over
it;
and
it
continued
to-ing
and
fro-ing
with
the
lithe,
sinister
restlessness
of
a
beast
in
a
cage.
i
could
not
cry
out,
although
as
you
may
suppose,
i
was
terrified.
its
pace
was
growing
faster,
and
the
room
rapidly
darker
and
darker,
and
at
length
so
dark
that
i
could
no
longer
see
anything
of
it
but
its
eyes.
i
felt
it
spring
lightly
on
the
bed.
the
two
broad
eyes
approached
my
face,
and
suddenly
i
felt
a
stinging
pain
as
if
two
large
needles
darted,
an
inch
or
two
apart,
deep
into
my
chest.
i
waked
with
a
scream.
evil
is
not
a
thing.
it
cannot
take
possession
of
you.
it;s
the
opposite;
it;s
a
void,
an
absence
of
goodness.
the
only
thing
you
can
be
frightened
of
here
is
yourself.
almira
gulch,
just
because
you
own
half
the
county
doesn;t
mean
that
you
have
the
power
to
run
the
rest
of
us.
for
twenty-three
years,
i;ve
been
dying
to
tell
you
what
i
thought
of
you!
and
now...
well,
being
a
christian
woman,
i
can;t
say
it!
i
didn;t
know
she
had
a
pony.
how
was
i
to
know
she
had
a
pony?
who
figures
an
immigrant;s
going
to
have
a
pony?
do
you
know
what
the
odds
are
on
that?
i
mean,
in
all
the
pictures
i
saw
of
immigrants
on
boats
coming
into
new
york
harbor,
i
never
saw
one
of
them
sitting
on
a
pony.
why
would
anybody
come
here
if
they
had
a
pony?
who
leaves
a
country
packed
with
ponies
to
come
to
a
non-pony
country?
it
doesn;t
make
sense.
am
i
wrong?
it
rasped
her,
though,
to
have
stirring
about
in
her
this
brutal
monster!
to
hear
twigs
cracking
and
feel
hooves
planted
down
in
the
depths
of
that
leaf-encumbered
forest,
the
soul;
never
to
be
content
quite,
or
quite
secure,
for
at
any
moment
the
brute
would
be
stirring,
this
hatred,
which,
especially
since
her
illness,
had
power
to
make
her
feel
scraped,
hurt
in
her
spine;
gave
her
physical
pain,
and
made
all
pleasure
in
beauty,
in
friendship,
in
being
well,
in
being
loved
and
making
her
home
delightful
rock,
quiver,
and
bend
as
if
indeed
there
were
a
monster
grubbing
at
the
roots,
as
if
the
whole
panoply
of
content
were
nothing
but
self
love!
this
hatred!
if
an
exoplanet
happens
to
transit
its
star,
we
can
often
determine
both
its
mass
and
its
radius,
and
hence
estimate
its
density
and
possibly
even
its
composition.
more
than
200
transiting
hot
jupiters
have
been
measured
in
this
way.
but
when
astronomers
calculate
their
densities
the
numbers
they
obtain
are
generally
much
lower
than
predicted
by
theory.
a
robot
may
not
injure
a
human
being,
or,
through
inaction,
allow
a
human

to
come
to

a
robot
must
obey
the
orders
given
it
by
human
beings
except
where
such
orders
would
conflict
with
the
first

a
robot
must
protect

that
i
should
want

strikes
me
as
the
height
of

probably
the
reason.

have
that
in

our
contempt

to

yourself,
"are

exists
in

a
strong

to

imagine
a

on
which
straight

instead
of

move
freely

without
the

very
much
like

and
you
will
then
have
a
pretty
correct
notion
of
my
country
and

i;m
waking
up
to
ash
and

i
wipe
my

and
i

up,

checking
out
on

is
it,
the
apocalypse.

yes?

next,

are
you
going
to

is
this
the

monotony

novelty
unfolds

you
can
exercise
daily
and
eat
healthily
and
live
a
long
life,
while
experiencing
a
short
one.
if
you
spend
your
life
sitting
in
a
cubicle
and
passing

one
day
is
bound
to
blend
unmemorably
into
the
next
-
and
disappear.
that;s
why
it;s
so
important
to
change

regularly,
and
take
vacations
to
exotic
locales,
and
have
as
many
new
experiences
as
possible
that
can
serve
to
anchor
our
memories.
creating
new

stretches
out
psychological

and
lengthens
our

hence
the
saying:
if
you
know
the
enemy
and
know
yourself,
you
need
not
fear
the
result
of
a
hundred
battles.
if
you
know
yourself
but
not
the
enemy,
for
every
victory
gained
you
will
also
suffer
a
defeat.
if
you
know
neither
the
enemy
nor
yourself,
you
will
succumb
in
every
battle.

yourself
in
a
boat
on
a
river,
with
tangerine

quite
slowly
-

with
kaleidoscope

for
the

with

she;s
gone.
you

i
don;t
really

sometimes
you
look
like
a

but
then
the
way

draws
you,
you
look...
like
a
hairy
ape,
with
all
these
wavy,
stinky
lines
undulating
off
your
body.
i
don;t
really
know
what
to

this
is
one
time
where

can
hear
its
whispers
coming
from

down,
deep
down

please!
you
must
find
my

it
at

and
whatever

as
i
mentioned
earlier,
miss
lucy
has,
for
reasons
that
remain
a

to
me,
unlocked
certain
portions
of
her

that
offer
access
to
previously
unexplored
cerebral
zones.
i;m
going
to
improvise.
listen,
there;s
something
you
should
know
about
me...
about
inception.
an
idea
is
like
a
virus,
resilient,
highly
contagious.
the
smallest
seed
of
an
idea
can
grow.
it
can
grow
to
define
or
destroy
you.
my
severe
injuries
had
healed
and
the
sweet
taste
of
blood
coated
my
mouth.
i
kept
walking,
my
goal
vague,
trying
to
dispel
the
building
unease
in
my
chest.
upon
entering
an
open
area
was
the
scent
of
rotting
flowers
and
in
the
middle
of
the
flowerbed,
he
stood.
without
anyone
saying
a
thing,
without
his
name
given,
like
an
unsolved
puzzle
falling
into
place
by
itself,
just
by
seeing
that
figure,
i
understood
exactly
who
i
faced.
in
my
younger
and
more
vulnerable
years
my
father
gave
me
some
advice
that
i;ve
been
turning
over
in
my
mind
ever
since.
"whenever
you
feel
like
criticizing
anyone,"
he
told
me,
"just
remember
that
all
the
people
in
this
world
haven;t
had
the
advantages
that
you;ve
had."
he
didn;t
say
any
more
but
we;ve
always
been
unusually
communicative
in
a
reserved
way
and
i
understood
that
he
meant
a
great
deal
more
than
that.
as
a
manager
you
will
also
be
able
to
control
gravity.
sir
isaac
newton
showed
that
dense
objects,
such
as
managers,
have
more
gravity.
your
office
will
become
a
black
hole
into
which
all
employee
input
will
be
lost
forever.
no
matter
how
many
times
your
employees
give
you
something
-
diskettes,
documents,
whatever
-
you
can
claim
you
never
got
it.
best
of
all,
it;s
not
your
fault;
it;s
the
law
of
gravity.
remember
that
all
the
people
in
this
world
haven;t
had
the
advantages
that
you;ve
had.
the
term
first
contact
applies
to
the
moment
when
we
employ
a
means
of
communication
with
alien
beings
that
also
have
a
means
of
talking
back
to
us.
there
are
several
ways
first
contact
could
happen.
the
most
popular
idea,
originating
from
the
ufo
phenomenon,
is
the
image
of
et

the

house
and
greeting
the
president.
however,
scientists
hope
they
are
the
first
to
establish
communication
with
et,

signals.

money
is
like
other
goods:
the
higher
the
opportunity
cost,
the
less
of
it
we
want
to
hold.
consider,
first,
how
the
transactions;
demand
for
money
(i.e.,
the
money
held
to
facilitate
purchases
of
goods
and
services)
is
affected
by
higher
interest
rates.
when
the
opportunity
cost
of
money
is
high,
we
lose
interest
by
holding
more
of
it,
so
we
find
ways
to
hold
less.
for
example,
if
interest
rates
are
high
enough,
we
might
reduce
the
funds
in
our
pockets
and
in
our
bank
accounts
and
take
funds
out
of
interest-bearing
mutual
funds
in
smaller
amounts
more
frequently.

almost
immediately
aesma
found
the
estate
of
the
master
of
space-time,
a
lunar
domain
of
immense
proportions.
it
was
incredibly
hard
to
miss
the
master,
as
he
was
a
man
thirty
stories
tall,
with
skin
speckled
as
a
night
sky,
and
in
his
tangled
hair,
among
his
shaggy
brow,
and
scattered
in
his
great
knotted
beard
were
a
multitude
of
burning
stars.
he
had
served
for
uncounted
centuries
as
chief
architect
of
the
gods
after
attaining
his
mastery,
and
even
now
was
building
a
mighty
dark
tower
greater
than
any
mountain,
and
the
clangs
of
his
immense
silver
chisel
shivered
aesma;s
bones
as
she
approached.
but
she
had
little
regard
for
his
mighty
stature
as
a
furious
mischief

in
her.

that;s
the
main
reason
i
kept
it
back.
if
i
were
to
give
you
an
analogy,
i;d
describe
it
like
this:
when
a
duck
swims
on
the
water,
you
only
see
it
glide,
apparently
effortlessly
across
the
lake.
but
underneath,
as
in
beneath
the
surface,
it;s
a
whole
different
story.

legs
are
moving

it;s

bicycle

well,
that;s
me
right
now.
i
am

duck!
my
older
brother,
tom,
had
spent
the
last
month
digging
in
the
cornfield.
ever
since
turning
17
he
had
an
urge
to
dig.
nobody
knew
why
he
was
digging
-
he
just
was.
when
anyone
asked
him
why,
he
would
only
say,
"i;m
digging
for
mom."
i
didn;t
know
how
digging
a
hole
was
good
for
mom,
and
didn;t
question
it.
if
he
wanted
to
get
in
trouble
with
her,
that
was
up
to
him.
now
you
listen
to
me.
while
i
will
admit
to
a
certain
cynicism,
the
fact
is
that
i
am
a
naysayer
and
hatchetman
in
the
fight
against
violence.
i
pride
myself
in
taking
a
punch
and
i;ll
gladly
take
another
because
i
choose
to
live
my
life
in

one
time
i
accidentally
drank
an

of
vinegar.
i
thought
it
was
terrible
wine.
once,
i
went
out
with
a
guy
who
wore
3d
glasses
the
entire
evening.
oh,
one
time
i
rode
in
a
sidecar
on
a
guy;s
motorcycle,
and
the
sidecar
detached
and
went
down
a
flight
of
stairs.
another
time
i
went
to
a
really
boring
movie
with
a
guy,
and
while
i
was
asleep
he
tried
to
pull
out
one
of
my

i
literally
woke
up
with
his
hand
in
my

went
out
a

times

that

he
got
weird.

i;ll
never

but
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
can
say
anything

his
whole

was...
why,
in

25
years

and
his

started
this

the
treatment
of
atoms
with

requires
consideration
of
the

and
an
extra
quantum
number
which
specifies
the
intrinsic

of
the

all
these

are
necessary

he
had
thought
it
was
the
most
stupid
and
reactionary
remark
he
ever
heard
in

was
it
any

the

the
problem
we

is
that
this
thin

of

is
being
thickened
by
huge
quantities
of
human-caused
carbon
dioxide
and
other
greenhouse
gases.
and
as
it
thickens,
it
traps
a
lot
of
the
infrared
radiation
that
would
otherwise
escape
the

and
continue
out
to
the

the

why?
because
they
lack
an
appreciation

indolence,

ultimately
undermining

the
world
of
typing
has
changed.
in
the
1970s,
every
business
had
rooms
full
of
secretaries
whose
job
it
was
to
type
letters
that
had
been
hand-written.
they
were
copying
the
writing
into
a
more
readable
format.
in
the
early
1980s,
the
personal
computer
became
a
common
office
machine.
as
for
me,
i
am
tormented
with
an
everlasting
itch
for
things
remote.
i
love
to
sail
forbidden
seas,
and
land
on
barbarous
coasts.
in
the
early
days
of
paperback
books,
the
paper
used
was
very
low
quality,
usually
newsprint.
consumers
rejected
the
soiled
and
discolored
appearance
of
the
pages.
publishers
hit
upon
the
notion
of
"staining,"
which
made
the
paper
look
fresh,
even
pretty,
and
most
important,
prolonged
the
shelf
life
of
their
books.
that;s
exactly
why
i
came
here.
i
love

bacteria
may
be
conveniently
grouped
under
two

those
that

known
as
the
saprophytic
forms,
and
those
that
are
found
in
living
plants
or
animals,
the
true
parasites.
such
a
grouping
is
not
always
entirely
satisfactory,
for
many
of
the
kinds
that
live
saprophytically
under
normal
conditions
may
become
parasitic
if
opportunity
offers,
and
also
many
of
those
that
are
usually
regarded
as
parasitic
may
be
grown
in
cultures
of
agar
or
other
media,
under
which
conditions
they
may
be
regarded
as
living

the

of

therefore
if
the

themselves
(which
is
the
root
of
the

are
confused
and
over
hastily
abstracted
from

there

i
used
to
analyze
myself
down

myself

words
of
those
to
whom
i;d
tried
to
be

everything
in

viciously
at
my
attempts
"to
be

and
suddenly,
in
the

of
my
laughing,
i;d
give
way
to
sadness,
fall
into
ludicrous
despondency
and
once
again
start
the
whole
process
all
over
again

deciding
which
way
round
to
print
the
question

wasn;t
as
straightforward
as
you
might
think,
incidentally.
in
its
traditional
orientation,
with

cup
an

which
seems
natural
enough,
though
perhaps
only
because
that;s
how
we
are
used
to
seeing
it.
but
people
have
always
played
around
with
it.
in
the
16th
century
the
printer
henry
denham
had
the
sophisticated
idea
of
reversing
the

when
indicating
a
rhetorical
question
(to
differentiate
it
from
a
direct
question),
but
it
didn;t
catch
on.

sidelong

it
was
often
said
that
she
had
an
iron
in
every
fire
and
a
scheme
for
every
enemy,
even
the
ones
that
she
currently
regarded
as
friends.
her
true
age
was
a
hotly
debated
topic
in
the
chateau
-
she
had
been
the

as
long
as
anyone
could
remember
but
retained
the
body
of
a
fragile,
waif-thin
youth.

cascaded
down

back

the

fierce

true
age.
looking
into

by

it;s
a
good

and
that,

why
we

i
thought
back
on
my
running
career
at

i;d
competed
with,
and
against,
men
far
better,
faster,
more
physically

many
were
future
olympians.
and
yet
i;d
trained
myself
to
forget
this
unhappy
fact.
people
reflexively
assume
that
competition
is
always
a
good
thing,
that
it
always
brings
out
the
best
in
people,
but
that;s
only
true
of
people
who
can
forget
the
competition.
the
art
of
competing,
i;d
learned
from
track,
was
the
art
of
forgetting,
and
i
now
reminded
myself
of
that
fact.
you
must
forget
your
limits.
you
must
forget
your
doubts,
your
pain,
your
past.

about

even

your

watching

there

some
of

sad,
some
funny.
some
of

are

of

some
are

they
all
have
about

a
sense
of

-
the
mystery

the
mystery
of

the
opposite
of

is

filth

that

squidward

really
making

i

my

morphic
resonance
is
a
process
whereby
self-organising
systems
inherit
a
memory
from
previous
similar
systems.
in
its
most
general
formulation,
morphic
resonance
means
that
the
so-called
laws
of
nature
are
more
like
habits.
the
hypothesis
of
morphic
resonance
also
leads
to
a
radically
new
interpretation
of

the

were
right:

at
first
we
were
silent,
but
finally
we
considered
ourselves
under
the
necessity
of
protesting
against
such
an
unjust
and
serious
accusation,
before
the
face
of
the
whole
of
intellectual
society.
thousands
of
groups
exist
to
influence

among
the
major
types
of
interest
groups
are
those
that
represent
the
main
sectors
of
the
economy.
in

many
public-interest
organizations
have
been
formed
to
represent
the
needs
of
the
general

including
some
single-issue
groups.
in
another
experiment
involving
students,
respondents
were
asked
about
likely
future
outcomes
for
themselves
and
their
roommates.
they
typically
had
very
rosy
views
about
their
own
futures,
which
they
imagined
to
include
successful
careers,
happy
marriages,
and
good
health.
when
asked
to
speculate
about
their
roommates;
futures,
however,
their
responses
were
far
more
realistic.
the
roommates
were
believed
to
be
far
more
likely
to
become
alcoholics,
suffer
illnesses,
get
divorced,
and
experience
a
variety
of
other
unfavorable
outcomes.

i
was

to

you;d
stood

up.
i
thought
to
myself,
"wendy,
is
mario

and
then
i
dozed

mr.

me
to

he
wanted

a

saw
the

and
asked
him,
"can
i
also

you
and
do
nothing
all

the
crow
answered:
"sure,
why
not?"

the
rabbit
sat
on
the
ground
below
the
crow,
and
rested.
all

a
fox

jumped
on

they

how
to

and
they
showed
me
a

where
i
could
be
so
dependable,

to

for
them
in
an
open
and

what
ensued?

to
some,
the

unsavory

from

that

at

the

there

is
this
so?
the
most

reason
is
the
great
admiration

for

of

-

the
thousands,
and
have
them
copied
in
even
greater
numbers;
their
own
production
was
clearly
based
on
greek
sources,
and
many
of
their
artists,
from

times
to
the

of

it

to
believe
there
were
no
such

as
the
blibbering

the
thing
about
growing
up

is
that
you
sort
of
start
thinking
anything;s
possible
if
you;ve
got
enough

and
now,
harry,
let
us
step
out

;no,

;we;re

;that

than
it;s

said
harry.
;and
quite
honestly,;
he
turned
away
from

thinking
now
only
of
the

waiting

of
both
inflicting

and
remedying

of
course
it
is
happening
inside

harry,
but
why
on
earth
should
that
mean
that
it
is
not
real?
a
common
mistake
that

trying
to

to

the

complete
fools.

it
can
be
very
dangerous

from

in

the

happen
to
be

and

they
could
be
about

all
the
difference
it

i;m

know
that

when

of
the

until
we
do,
these

still

that
makes

have
to
understand,
most
of

of

hopelessly

you
give
them.

how

you;re

whom
i

no
great
interest.

all
at
once
an
envelope
attracted
my

bore
my
name

in
a

firm
hand;
tears
filled
my
eyes.
here
was
a
letter
from
my
dearest
friend,
the
one
in
whom
i
used
to
confide
in
my
youth
and
who
knew
my
hopes;
he
arose
before
me
so
clearly
with
his
outstretched
hand
and
good-natured
smile
that
a
shudder
ran
through
my
frame.
yes,
the
dead
come
back,
for
i
saw
him!
our
memory
is
a
world
far
more
perfect
than
the
real
universe,
for
it
brings
to
life
those
who
have
gone
forever.
my
romances,
whose
heroines,
if
still
living,
must
have
white
hair,
arose
before
me
with
all
the
bitterness
of
loved
things
forever
gone.
oh,
the
young
brows
shaded
by
golden
hair,
the
clasped
hands,
the
speaking
glances,
the
throbbing
hearts,
the
smile
that
promises
the
lips
and
the
lips
that
promise
all-then
the
first
kiss-long,
unending,
with
no
thought
but
of
the
immense
ecstasy
to
come!
my
dear
mamma:
i
am
seven
years
old
today.
as
it
is
the
age
of
reason,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
having
brought
me
into
this
world.
there
was
a
lot
of
time,
but
there
was
no
money
and
no
place
to
go.
there
were
big
hopes,
but
living
every
day
was
full
of
worry
and
when
she
walked
down
the
streets
everyone
else
looked
like
they
were
full
of
confidence
and
she
looked
really
small.
dear
auggie,
i
want
to
apologise
for
the
stuff
i
did
last
year.
i;ve
been
thinking
about
it
a
lot.
you
didn;t
deserve
it.
i
wish
i
could
have
a
do-over.
i
would
be
nicer.
i
hope
you
don;t
remember
how
mean
i
was
when
you;re
eighty
years
old.
have
a
nice
life.

in
late
june
1945,
working
at
los
alamos,
von
neumann
completed
a
101-page
document
titled
"first
draft
of
a
report
on
the
edvac".
in
his
clear
and
penetrating
way,
he
set
forth
an
overview
of
the
design
of
a
digital
computer
that
would
feature
stored-program
operation.
von
neumann
boldly
drew
comparisons
between
his
electronic
circuits
and
the
brain;s
neurons,
emphasizing
that
just
as
the
brain
relies
on
its
memory,
so
the
computer
would
depend
on
its
programs.
goldstine

the

how
much
was
gone
already?
the
sacred
idiom
shorn
of
its
referents
and
so
of
its
reality.
alone
now,
i
leaned
over
the
edge
of
my
boat
and
looked
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea.
the
volcano
was
gone.
the

calm

reflected
the
blue
of

little
waves--like
silk

fluttering
in

against
the
side
of
the

there
was
nothing
else.
i
stretched
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
closed
my
eyes,
waiting
for
the
rising
tide
to
carry
me
where
i
belonged.
i;m
gonna
tell
you
a
story.
you
go
to
a
party
and
you
walk
up
to
the
guys
and
you;re
like,
"i
just
bought
a
two
thousand
dollar
big
screen
tv,
and
surround
sound."
or
you
walk
up
to
the
wife
and
you;re
like,
"what
do
you
think
of
my
new
fifteen
hundred
dollar
earrings
i
bought
for
you."
and
nobody
bats
an
eye.
but
you
mention
once
that
you;re
thinking
about
spending
seventeen
hundred
dollars
on
a
set
of
headphones,
and
everybody
loses
their
mind!
and
i
don;t
understand
why.
the
man
squatted
and
looked
at
him.
i;m
scared,
he
said.
do
you
understand?
i;m
scared.
the
boy
didn;t
answer.
he
just
sat
there
with
his
head
bowed,
sobbing.
you;re
not
the
one
who
has
to
worry
about
everything.
the
boy
said
something
but
he
couldn;t
understand
him.
what?
he
said.
he
looked
up,
his
wet
and
grimy
face.
yes
i
am,
he
said.
i

the

the
interconnected
internet
platforms
have
become
more
substantial
than
any
country
or

humans
have
redefined
the
"net"
and
how
we
interact
with
it.
as
technology
develops,
the
virtual
world
is
now
capable
of
replacing
the
real
one.
using
a
device
installed
behind
the

humans
can
now
easily
sync
to
the
virtual

thus,
life
is
now
completely
different
than
the
past
centuries.
the

the

alive,
including
the
reactions
that
produce

of

let;s
talk
about

i
like
waffles.
waffles
are
cool.
waffles
is
a
funny
word.
there;s
a
teen
titans
go

called
"waffles"
where
the
word
"waffles"
is
said
a
hundred-something
times.
it;s
pretty
annoying.
it;s
crazy
to
think
that
everything
we
could
ever
possibly
say
or
write
is
massively
outweighed
by
meaningless
strings
of
letters
and
punctuation.
this
one
time,
me
and
my
mom
were
going
to
go
to
a
furry
christmas
party,
but
we
didn;t
end
up
going
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
alcohol
on
the
premises,
and
that
she
didn;t
wanna
have
to
be
a
mom
dragging
her
son
through
a
crowd
of
furries.
both
of
those
reasons
were
understandable.
okay,
hopefully
i
won;t
have
to
talk
about
furries
anymore.
hello,
i;m
back
once
again.
happy
pi
day!
i
memorized
a
bunch
of
digits
of
pi
once,
not
sure
how
many
i
still
remember...
i
have
literally
nothing
to
write
about
now.
all
i
hear
right
now
is
baby
shark
being
blasted
upstairs.
all
the
world;s
a
stage,
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players.
;but
does
it
not
show
great
weakness?;
pursued
she.
;i;m
not
envious:
i
never
feel
hurt
at
the
brightness
of
isabella;s
yellow
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
skin,
at
her
dainty
elegance,
and
the
fondness
all
the
family
exhibit
for
her.
even
you,
nelly,
if
we
have
a
dispute
sometimes,
you
back
isabella
at
once;
and
i
yield
like
a
foolish
mother:
i
call
her
a
darling,
and
flatter
her
into
a
good
temper.
it
pleases
her
brother
to
see
us
cordial,
and
that
pleases
me.
but
they
are
very
much
alike:
they
are
spoiled
children,
and
fancy
the
world
was
made
for
their
accommodation;
and
though
i
humour
both,
i
think
a
smart
chastisement
might
improve
them
all
the
same.;

the
cup,
and
in

have
you
ever
had
a
dream,
neo,
that
you
seemed
so
sure
it
was
real?
but
if
you
were
unable
to
wake
from
that
dream,
how
would
you
tell
the
difference
between
the
dream
world
&
the
real
world?
well,
women
in
london
must;ve
learned
not
to

i
think
the
real
tragedy
is
in
the
inner
war
which
is
waged
between
people
who
love
each
other,
a
war
out
of
which
comes
knowledge.
what
he
had
seen
and
felt
and
known
he
gave
in
his
writing
to
his
fellow

the
splendour

the
hope
of
more
and
more
life...
a
heroic
and
immeasurable
gift.
"can
it
be
getting
dark
so
soon?"
he
winced
up
at
the
sun.
it;s
growing
dim
and
i
thought
that
the
day
had
just
begun.
i
think,
before
i
travel
on,
i;ll
get
a

little
rest...
and,
quietly,
the
boy
died
from
that
small
pain
in
his
chest.
don;t
you
remember,
ma,
when
i
went
off
to
war,
you
thought
it
was
the
best
thing
i
could
do?
i
was
on
the
battleground,
you
were
home...
acting
proud.
you
wasn;t
there
standing
in
my
shoes.
i
can;t
do
shorthand
and
typewriting
and
double-entrance
book-keeping,
or
whatever
it;s
called.
i
tell
you,
i
am
utterly
incompetent.
i
never
earn
anything.
i;m
the
parasite
of
the
british
oak,
like
the
mistletoe.
the
blue
bird
doesn;t
flutter
round
my
feet.
perhaps
they;re
too
big
and
trampling.
;thank
you,
my
dear,
for
your
offer,;
said
the
wife,
rising,
;but
i;m
afraid
no
man
can
expect
two
blue
birds
of
happiness
to
flutter
round
his
feet,
tearing
out
their
little
feathers!;
the
school
stared
in
perplexity
at
this
incredible
folly.
tom
stood
a
moment
to
gather
his
dismembered
faculties;
and
when
he
stepped
forward
to
go
to
his
punishment,
the
surprise,
the
gratitude,
the
adoration
that
shone
upon
him
out
of
poor
becky;s
eyes
seemed
pay
enough
for
a
hundred
floggings.
inspired
by
the
splendour
of
his
own
act,
he
took
without
an
outcry
the
most
merciless
flogging
that
even
mr.
dobbins
had
ever
administered;
and
also
received
with
indifference
the
added
cruelty
of
a
command
to
remain
two
hours
after
school
should
be
dismissed
-
for
he
knew
who
would
wait
for
him
outside
till
his
captivity
was
done,
and
not
count
the
tedious
time
as
loss
either.
fret
not,
my
dear
friend,
for
i
have
learned
the
truth.
it
matters
not
whether
one
is
dirty
or
clean,
for
can
cleanliness
exist
without
filthiness,
and
would
we
know
filthiness
without
cleanliness?
we
must
not
re-enact
the
history
that
divides
us,
rather
we
must
embrace
that
which
draws
us
together.
so
if
you
want
to
find
somebody
to
blame
for
the
way
i
am,
i
guess
you;d
have
to
start
with
the
public
education
system.

when
he
got
an

it
took
him
such
a
time.
people
won;t
wait.
he
lost
everybody.
and
there
he;d
sit,
goin;
on
and
on--i
will
say
that
for
him--not
a
man

made
a
better

look
at
the
competition!
he
never
advertised!

well,
there
it
is.
what
could
you
expect
with
his
ideas?
annihilation
is
always
the
answer.
we
destroy
parts
of
ourselves
everyday.
we
photoshop
our
warts
away,
we
edit
the
parts
we
hate
about
ourselves,
modify
the
parts
we
think
people
hate.
we
curate
our
identity,
carve
it,
distill
it.
krista;s
wrong
-
annihilation
is
all
we
are.
you
know
what
my
favorite
color
combination
is?
yellow
text
on
a
magenta
background.
oh,
and
don;t
forget
the
comic
sans.
that
is
just
pure
beauty
right
there.
in
fact,
it;s
used
in
the
first
frame
(well,
close
enough)
of
"history
of
the
entire

i
guess",
which
makes
me
love
that
video
even
more.
he
pictured
the
boys
finding
his
body
next
day.
suddenly
he
found
himself
with
them,
coming
along
the
trail
and
looking
for
himself.
and,
still
with
them,
he
came
around
a
turn
in
the
trail
and
found
himself
lying
in
the
snow.
he
did
not
belong
with
himself
any
more,
for
even
then
he
was
out
of
himself,
standing
with
the
boys
and
looking
at
himself
in
the
snow.
it
certainly
was
cold,
was
his
thought.
when
he
got
back
to
the
states
he
could
tell
the
folks
what
real
cold
was.
he
drifted
on
from
this
to
a
vision
of
the
old-timer
on
sulphur
creek.
he
could
see
him
quite
clearly,
warm
and
comfortable,
and
smoking
a
pipe.
hi,
i;m
back
again.
my
computer
crashed
again,
and
i
was
ignorant
enough
to
not
save
my
work,
so
that
means
i
have
to
start
this
part
of
the
text
all
over
again.
that;s
quite
unfortunate.
but
did
i
mention
that
my
google
chrome
is
working
again?
that;s
the
good
news.
once
upon
a
time,
people
got
tired
of
starting
off
their
stories
with
"once
upon
a
time",
so
they
stopped
doing
that.
but
one
person
decided
not
to
stop
using
"once
upon
a
time",
and
used
it
at
the
beginning
of
this
story.
and
that
person
is
me!
the
end.
you
see
i
used
to
watch
him.
never
gave
;imself
time
to
eat;
never
had
a
penny
in
the
house.
all
went
in
rent
and
leather.
how
he
lived
so
long
i
don;t
know.
he
regularly
let
his
fire
go
out.
he
was
a
character.
but
he
made
good
boots.
think
of
love
as
a
state
of
grace:
not
the
means
to
anything
but
the
alpha
and
omega,
an
end
in
itself.
today,
when
i
saw
you,
i
realized
that
what
is
between
us
is
nothing
more
than
an
illusion.
it
was
the
year
they
fell
into
devastating
love.
neither
one
could
do
anything
except
think
about
the
other,
dream
about
the
other,
and
wait
for
letters
with
the
same
impatience
they
felt
when
they
answered
them.
we
didn;t
give
up
on
our
dreams!
we
changed
our
dreams
into
your
dream.
that;s
what
parents
do.
that;s
what
family
does.
the
only
thing
he
could
do
to
stay
alive
was
not
to
allow
himself
the
anguish
of
that
memory.
he
erased
it
from
his
mind,
although
from
time
to
time
in
the
years
that
were
left
to
him
he
would
feel
it
revive,
with
no
warning
and
for
no
reason,
like
the
sudden
pang
of
an
old
scar.
everyday
people
keep
hurting
each
other,
it;s
no
wonder
why
you
doubt
what
other
people
in
the
world
tell
you.
fun
things.
happy
things.
they;ll
all
eventually
change
someday,
you
know?
but
can
you
still
love
this
place?
the
shape
of
the
wedding
ring
has
two
meanings.
one
is
eternity.
the
other
is
completeness.
you
shouldn;t
hold
back
your
tears.
you
should
let
it
all
out
while
you
still
can
-
because
when
you
get
bigger
sometimes
you
can;t
cry
even
if
you
have
something
to
cry
about.
if
i;m
around
you,
i
don;t
think
i;ll
ever
be
bored.
we
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
one
and
only
life
we;re
given,
no
matter
how
cruel
and
heartless
it
might
be.
one
person
needed
courage
to
face
the
past.
another
person
needed
effort
to
make
a
dream
come
true.
yet
another
person
needed
time
and
friends.
what
about
you?
even
if
we
forget
the
faces
of
our
friends,
we
will
never
forget
the
bonds
that
were
carved
into
our
souls.
no
matter
what
kind
of
past
you
had,
don;t
lose
sight
of
yourself.
if
i
can
meet
you
again,
against
the
6
billion
to
1
odds,
and
even
if
your
body
can;t
move,
i;ll
marry
you.
even
if
you
can;t
walk
or
stand
and
even
if
you
can;t
have
kids,
i;ll
still
marry
you,
i;ll
always
stay
by
your
side.
i
heard
that
when
things
were
painful
for
her,
she;d
cover
her
ears
with
headphones
and
escape
to
the
world
of
music.
i
tried
it
too.
it
was
like
everything
was
blown
away.
the
vocals
screamed
for
me.
they
grieved
for
me.
the
ones
who
put
on
the
act
of
common
sense
were
wrong.
those
who
cried
were
right.
once
you;ve
been
loved
once
and
have
loved
once,
you
cannot
forget
it.
they
come
without
asking,
and
then
they
leave
just
the
same.
but
once
you
meet
them,
even
if
nobody
ever
knows
it,
that
encounter
will
change
your
life
for
the
better.
it;s
times
like
this
that
i
wish
i
could
come
up
with
an
appropriate
response.
i
hate
myself
for
not
being
able
to
reply
properly.
i
may
not
have
anywhere
to
go...
but
i
can;t
just
selfishly
disappear
either.
it;s
strange
isn;t
it.
the
two
groups,
which
looked
like
they
hated
each
other,
are
now
shining
the
same
color
as
they
vanish
into
the
distant
sky.
you
know
mitch,
now
that
i;m
dying.
i;ve
become
much
more
interesting
to
people.
i
thought
about
all
the
people
i
knew
who
spent
many
of
their
waking
hours
feeling
sorry
for
themselves.
how
useful
it
would
be
to
put
a
daily
limit
on
self-pity.

a
few
tearful
minutes,

on
with
the
day.
he
feared

he;d

that
his
soul
would
slip
down
into

the
day

cut
his
pillow.
if
you
could
see
everything
but
couldn;t
change
any
of
it,
or
if
you
could
live
in
freedom
in
darkness...
which
do
you
think
is
more
fortunate?
i
think
it
might
not
be
that
bad
living
in
the
dark,
remembering
the
light.
als
is
like
a
lit
candle:
it
melts
your
nerves
and
leaves
your
body
a
pile
of
wax.
often,
it
begins
with
the
legs
and
works
its
way
up.
you
lose
control
of
your
thigh
muscles,
so
that
you
cannot
support
yourself
standing.
you
lose
control
of
your
trunk
muscles,
so
that
you
cannot
sit
up
straight.
by
the
end,
if
you
are
still
alive,
you
are
breathing
through
a
tube
in
a
hole
in
your
throat,
while
your
soul,
perfectly
awake,
is
imprisoned
inside
a
limp
husk,
perhaps
able
to
blink,
or
cluck
a
tongue,
like
something
from
a
science
fiction
movie,
the
man
frozen
inside
his
own
flesh.

no
more
than
five
years

the
world,
i
discovered,
was
not
all
that
interested.
i
wandered
around
my
early
twenties,
paying
rent
and
reading
classifieds
and
wondering
why
the
lights
were
not
turning
green
for
me.
my
dream
was
to
be
a
famous
musician
(i
played
the
piano),
but
after
several
years
of
dark,
empty
nightclubs,
broken
promises,
bands
that
kept
breaking
and
producers
who
seemed
excited
about
everyone
but
me,
the
dream
soured.
i
was
failing
for
the
first
time
in
my
life.
after
the
funeral,
my
life
changed.
i
felt
as
if
time
were
suddenly
precious,
water
going
down
an
open
drain,
and
i
could
not
move
quickly
enough.
no
more
playing
music
at
half-empty
night
clubs.
no
more
writing
songs
in
my
apartment,
songs
that
no
one
would
hear.
miodec
you;ve
literally
made
one
the
best
typing

you
still
lazily
sit
there
watching
youtube
videos
with
a
measly
140
wpm
smh.
and
have
you
forgotten
about
tribes
completely?
that;s
like
saying
ur
gonna
kill
someone,
but
then
never
do
it
and
leave
them
scared
for
the
rest
of
their
life
(bad
example)

you
tell
us
about
tribes
and
leave
everyone
excited

never

well,
for
one
thing,
the
culture
we
have
does
not
make
people
feel
good
about
themselves.
we;re
teaching
the
wrong
things.
and
you
have
to
be
strong
enough
to
say
if
the
culture
doesn;t
work,
don;t
buy
it.
create
your
own.
most
people
can;t
do
it.
"you
see,"
he
says
to
the
girl,
"you
closed
your
eyes.
that
was
the
difference.
sometimes
you
cannot
believe
what
you
see,
you
have
to
believe
what
you
feel.
and
if
you
are
ever
going
to
have
other
people
trust
you,
you
must
feel
that
you
can
trust
them,
too---even
when
you;re
in
the
dark.
even
when
you;re
falling."

i

i
never
expected

success.
in
fact,
i
never
even
thought
of
commercial
publication
when
i
wrote
the

back
in
the
thirties.
it
all
began
when
i
was
reading
exam
papers
to
earn
a
bit
of
extra
money.
that
was
agony.
one
of
the
tragedies
of
the
underpaid
professor
is
that
he
has
to
do
menial
jobs.
he
is
expected
to
maintain
a
certain
position
and
to
send
his
children
to
good

well,
one
day
i
came
to
a
blank
page
in
an
exam
book
and
i
scribbled
on
it.
;in
a
hole
in
the
ground
there
lived
a
hobbit.;
i
knew
no
more
about
the
creatures
than
that,
and

was
years
before
his

i
don;t
know
where
the

from.

can;t
catch
your
mind
out.
it
might
have
been
associated
with
sinclair
lewis;s
babbitt.
certainly
not
rabbit,
as
some
people
think.
babbitt
has
the
same
bourgeois
smugness
that
hobbits
do.
his
world
is
the
same
limited
place.
"escaping
goblins
to
be
caught
by
wolves!"
he
said,
and
it
became
a
proverb,
though
we
now
say
"out
of
the
frying-pan
into
the
fire"
in
the
same
sort
of
uncomfortable
situations.
this
of
course
is
the
way
to
talk
to
dragons,
if
you
don;t
want
to
reveal
your
proper
name
(which
is
wise),
and
don;t
want
to
infuriate
them
by
a
flat
refusal
(which
is
also
very
wise).
no
dragon
can
resist
the
fascination
of
riddling
talk
and
of
wasting
time
trying
to
understand
it.
old
took;s
great-grand-uncle
bullroarer...was
so
huge
(for
a
hobbit)
that
he
could
ride
a
horse.
he
charged
the
ranks
of
the
goblins
of
mount
gram
in
the
battle
of
the
green
fields
and
knocked
their
king
golfimbul;s
head
clean
off
with
a
wooden
club.
it
sailed
a
hundred
yards
through
the
air
and
went
down
a
rabbit-hole,
and
in
this
way,
the
battle
was
won
and
the
game
of
golf
invented
at
the
same
moment.
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
there
lived
a
hobbit.
not
a
nasty,
dirty,
wet
hole,
filled
with
the
ends
of
worms
and
an
oozy
smell,
nor
yet
a
dry,
bare,
sandy
hole
with
nothing
in
it
to
sit
down
on
or
to
eat:
it
was
a
hobbit-hole,
and
that
means
comfort.
as
they
sang
the
hobbit
felt
the
love
of
beautiful
things
made
by
hands
and
by
cunning
and
by
magic
moving
through
him,
a
fierce
and
a
jealous
love,
the
desire
of
the
hearts
of
dwarves.
and
he
grew
and
grew
strong
as
a
boy
must
grow
who
does
not
know
that
he
is
learning
any
lessons,
and
who
has
nothing
in

to
think
of
except
things
to
eat.

gale
gave
me
a
sense
of
security
i;d
lacked
since
my

death.

replaced
the
long
solitary
hours
in

became
a

i

have
to
look
over
my

constantly,
when
someone
was
watching
my
back...
being
out
in

with

actually
happy.

piggy
moved
among
the

asking

to

they
had
given
to
the

to
have

to

the
darkness
of

the
fall
through
the

true,
wise
friend
called
piggy.

gathered
a

of

and

there
was
a
space
round

perhaps
six
yards
in

he
dare
not

here,
invisible
yet
strong,

the
taboo
of
the

he
knocked

there
is
nothing

to

find

it
is
not

quite
the
something
you

not

farewell,
king
under
the
mountain!
this
is
a
bitter
adventure,
if
it
must
end
so;
and
not
a

of

can
amend
it.
yet
i
am
glad
that
i
have
shared
in
your
perils
-
that
has
been
more
than
any
baggins
deserves.
then
bilbo
fled
[with
the
cup].
but
the
dragon
did
not
wake
-
not
yet
-
but
shifted
into
other
dreams
of
greed
and
violence,
lying
there
in
his
stolen
hall
while
the
little
hobbit
toiled
back
up
the
long
tunnel.
his
heart
was
beating
and
a
more
fevered
shaking
was
in
his
legs
than
when
he
was
going
down,
but
still
he
clutched
the
cup,
and
his
chief
thought
was:
;i;ve
done
it!
this
will
show
them.
;more
like
a
grocer
than
a
burglar;
indeed!
well,
we;ll
hear
no
more
of
that.;
;very
well!;
said
bilbo
very
downcast,
and
also
rather
annoyed.
;come
along
back
to
your
nice
cells,
and
i
will
lock
you
all
in
again,
and
you
can
sit
there
comfortably
and
think
of
a
better
plan-but
i
don;t
suppose
i
shall
ever
get
hold
of
the
keys
again,
even
if
i
feel
inclined
to
try.;
;it
will
not
be
long
now,;
thought
bilbo,
;before
the
goblins
win
the
gate,
and
we
are
all
slaughtered
or
driven
down
and
captured.

it
is
enough
to
make
one

after
all
one
has
gone

i
would
rather
old
smaug
had
been
left
with
all
the
wretched

than
that
these
vile
creatures

old
bombur,
and
balin
and

and

and
all
the
rest

to
a
bad
end;
and

and
the
lake-men
and
the
merry
elves.
misery
me!
i
have
heard
songs
of
many
battles,
and
i
have
always
understood
that
defeat
may
be
glorious.
it
seems
very
uncomfortable,
not
to
say
distressing.
i
wish
i
was
well
out
of
it.;
a
day
without
a
friend
is
like
a
pot
without
a

drop
of
honey
left
inside.
"all
the
same,
i
should
like
it
all
plain
and
clear,"
said
bilbo
obstinately,
putting
on
his
business
manner
(usually
reserved
for
people
who
tried
to
borrow
money
off
him),
and
doing
his
best
to
appear
wise
and
prudent
and
professional
and
live
up
to
gandalf;s
recommendation.
"also
i
should
like
to
know
about
risks,
out-of-pocket
expenses,
time
required
and
remuneration,
and
so
forth"
-
by
which
he
meant:
"what
am
i
going
to
get
out
of
it?
and
am
i
going
to
come
back
alive?"
here
is
my
message
to
those
beyond
our
borders.
america
has
been
tested
and
we
have
come
out
stronger
for
it.
we
will
repair
our
alliances
and
engage
with
the
world
once
again.
"then
the
prophecies
of
the
old
songs
have
turned
out
to
be
true,
after
a
fashion!"
said
bilbo.\n"of
course!"
said
gandalf.
"and
why
should
not
they
prove
true?
surely
you
don;t
disbelieve
the
prophecies,
because
you
had
a
hand
in
bringing
them
about
yourself?
you
don;t
really
suppose,
do
you,
that
all
your
adventures
and
escapes
were
managed
by
mere
luck,
just
for
your
sole
benefit?
you
are
a
very
fine
person,
mr.
baggins,
and
i
am
very
fond
of
you;
but
you
are
only
quite
a
little
fellow
in
a
wide
world
after
all!"\n"thank
goodness!"
said
bilbo
laughing,
and
handed
him
the
tobacco-jar.

of
all

vogon
poetry
is
of
course,
the
third
worst
in
the
universe.
the
second
worst
is
that
of
the
azgoths
of
kria.
during
a
recitation
by
their
poet
master
grunthos
the
flatulent
of
his
poem
"ode
to
a
small
lump
of
green
putty
i
found
in
my
armpit
one
midsummer
morning"
four
of
his
audience
died
of
internal
hemorrhaging
and
the
president
of
the
mid-galactic
arts
nobbling
council
survived
by
gnawing
one
of
his
own
legs
off.
grunthos
was
reported
to
have
been
"disappointed"
by
the
poem;s
reception,
and
was
about
to
embark
on
a
reading
of
his
12-book
epic
entitled
"my
favorite
bathtime
gurgles"
when
his
own
major
intestine,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
save
humanity,
leapt
straight
up
through
his
neck
and
throttled
his
brain.
the
very
worst
poetry
of
all
perished
along
with
its
creator,
paula
nancy
millstone
jennings
of
redbridge,
in
the
destruction
of
the
planet
earth.
vogon
poetry
is
mild
by
comparison.
i;ve
come
up
with
a
set
of
rules
that
describe
our
reactions
to
technologies:\n1.
anything
that
is
in
the
world
when
you;re
born
is
normal
and
ordinary
and
is
just
a
natural
part
of
the
way
the
world
works.\n2.
anything
that;s
invented
between
when
you;re
fifteen
and
thirty-five
is
new
and
exciting
and
revolutionary
and
you
can
probably
get
a
career
in
it.\n3.
anything
invented
after
you;re
thirty-five
is
against
the
natural
order
of
things.
how
can
i
make
him
understand
that
he
did
not
create
me?
he
makes
the
same
mistake
as
the
others
when
they
look
at
a
feeble-minded
person
and
laugh
because
they
don;t
understand
there
are
human
feelings
involved.
intelligence
is
one
of
the
greatest
human
gifts.
but
all
too
often
a
search
for
knowledge
drives
out
the
search
for
love.
this
is
something
else
i;ve
discovered
for
myself
very
recently.
i
present
it
to
you
as
a
hypothesis:
intelligence
without
the
ability
to
give
and
receive
affection
leads
to
mental
and
moral
breakdown,
to
neurosis,
and
possibly
even
psychosis.
and
i
say
that
the
mind
absorbed
in
and
involved
in
itself
as
a
self-centered
end,
to
the
exclusion
of
human
relationships,
can
only
lead
to
violence
and
pain.
the
masses
never
revolt
of
their
own
accord,
and
they
never
revolt
merely
because
they
are
oppressed.
indeed,
so
long
as
they
are
not
permitted
to
have
standards
of
comparison,
they
never
even
become
aware
that
they
are
oppressed.
the
major
problem
-
one
of
the
major
problems,
for
there
are
several
-
one
of
the
many
major
problems
with
governing
people
is
that
of
whom
you
get
to
do
it;
or
rather
of
who
manages
to
get
people
to
let
them
do
it
to
them.
to
summarize:
it
is
a
well-known
fact
that
those
people
who
must
want
to
rule
people
are,
ipso
facto,
those
least
suited
to
do
it.
to
summarize
the
summary:
anyone
who
is
capable
of
getting
themselves
made
president
should
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
do
the
job.
although
ford
had
taken
great
care
to
blend
into
earth
society,
he
had
;skimped
a
bit
on
his
preparatory
research,;
and
thought
that
the
name
;ford
prefect;
would
be
;nicely
inconspicuous.;
the
ford
prefect
was
a
popular
british
car
manufactured
from
1938
to
1961,
and
adams
later
clarified
in
an
interview
that
ford
"had
simply
mistaken
the
dominant
life
form"
of
earth.
this
was
expanded
on
somewhat
in
the
film
version,
where
ford
is
almost
run
over
while
attempting
to
greet
a
blue
ford
prefect.
he
is
saved
by
arthur
and,
in
the
film
version
of
events,
this
is
how
the
pair
meet
(this
meeting
also
prompting
ford
to
rescue
arthur
in
particular
when
the
vogons
come
to
destroy
earth).
he
almost
danced
to
the
fridge,
found
the
three
least
hairy
things
in
it,
put
them
on
a
plate
and
watched
them
intently
for
two
minutes.
since
they
made
no
attempt
to
move
within
that
time
he
called
them
breakfast
and
ate
them.
there
was
a
point
to
this
story,
but
it
has
temporarily
escaped
the
chronicler;s
mind.
let;s
think
the
unthinkable,
let;s
do
the
undoable.
let
us
prepare
to

with
the
ineffable
itself,
and
see
if
we
may
not

one
of
the
things
ford
had
always
found
hardest
to
understand
about
humans
was
their
habit
of
continually
stating
and
repeating
the
very
very
obvious,
as
in
;it;s
a
nice
day;,
;you;re
very
tall;,
or
;you
seem
to
have
fallen
down
a
thirty-foot
well,
are
you
alright?;
at
first
ford
had
formed
a
theory
to
account
for
this
strange
behavior.
if
human
beings
don;t
keep
exercising
their
lips,
he
thought,
their
mouths
probably
seize
up.
after
a
few
months;
consideration
and
observation,
he
abandoned
this
theory
in
favor
of
a
new
one.
if
they
don;t
keep
exercising
their
lips,
he
thought,
their
brains
start
working.
after
a
while
he
abandoned
this
one
as
well
as
being
obstructively
cynical,
and
decided
he
quite
liked
human
beings
after
all,
but
he
always
remained
desperately
worried
about
the
terrible
number
of
things
they
didn;t
know
about.

now.
for
instance,
on
the
planet
earth,
man
had
always
assumed
that
he
was
more
intelligent
than
dolphins
because
he
had
achieved
so
much
-
the
wheel,
new
york,
wars
and
so
on
-
whilst
all
the
dolphins
had
ever
done
was
muck
about
in
the
water
having
a
good
time.
but
conversely,
the
dolphins
had
always
believed
that
they
were
far
more
intelligent
than
man
-
for
precisely
the
same
reasons.

one
of
the
major
difficulties
trillian
experienced
in
her
relationship
with
zaphod
was
learning
to
distinguish
between
him
pretending
to
be
stupid
just
to
get
people
off
their
guard,
pretending
to
be
stupid
because
he
couldn;t
be
bothered
to
think
and
wanted
someone
else
to
do
it
for
him,
pretending
to
be
outrageously
stupid
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
actually
didn;t
understand
what
was
going
on,
and
really
being
genuinely
stupid.
he
felt
that
his
whole
life
was

kind
of

he
sometimes
wondered
whose
it

when
one
has
lived
for
quite
a
long
time
in
a
particular
civilization
and
has
often
tried
to
discover
what
its
origins
were
and
along
what
path
it
has
developed,
one
sometimes
also
feels
tempted
to
take
a
glance
in
the
other
direction
and
to
ask
what
further
fate
lies
before
it
and
what
transformations
it
is
destined
to
undergo.
but
one
soon
finds
that
the
value
of
such
an
enquiry
is
diminished
from
the
outset
by
several
factors.
above
all,
because
there
are
only
a
few
people
who
can
survey

activity
in
its
full
compass.
most
people
have
been
obliged
to
restrict
themselves
to
a
single,
or
a
few,
fields
of
it.

the
less
a
man
knows
about
the
past
and
the
present
the
more
insecure
must
prove
to
be
his
judgement
of
the
future.
and
there
is
the
further
difficulty
that
precisely
in
a
judgement
of
this
kind
the
subjective
expectations
of
the
individual
play
a
part
which
is
difficult
to
assess;
and
these
turn
out
to
be
dependent
on
purely
personal
factors
in
his
own
experiences,
on
the
greater
or
lesser
optimism
of
his
attitude
to
life,
as
it
has
been
dictated
for
him
by
his
temperament
or
by
his
success
or
failure.
finally,
the
curious
fact
makes
itself
felt
that
in
general
people
experience
their
present
naively,
as
it
were,
without
being
able
to
form
an
estimate
of
its
contents;
they
have
first
to
put
themselves
at
a
distance
from
it
-
the
present,
that
is
to
say,
must
have
become
the
past
-
before
it
can
yield
points
of
vantage
from
which
to
judge
the
future.

the

is
very
much
a

-
he
wields
no
real
power
whatsoever.
he
is
apparently
chosen
by
the
government,
but
the
qualities
he
is
required
to
display
are
not
those
of
leadership
but
those
of
finely
judged
outrage.
for
this
reason
the
president
is
always
a
controversial
choice,
always
an
infuriating

character.

not
to
wield

to

it;s
when
nothing
goes
the
way
you
want.
when
you;re
not
having
fun...
and
yet
you
still
want
to
be
with
that
person.
i
know
that
i;m
not
alone,
but
i
want
to
be
strong
even
when
i
am.
what
i
want
to
do
most?
let;s
see...
just
once,
i
really
want
to
let
loose
and
pee
in
my
pants.
there
is
no
reason
to
pretend
to
be
cool.
let;s
show
our
lame
sides.
that;s
who
we
really
are,
after
all.
treasure
the
experience.
dreams
fade
away
after
you
wake
up.
a
wise
person
once
said
that
you
can
never
lose
what
you
never
had.
but
you
can
go
into
debt.
sometimes,
it
lasts
all
night.
i
lie
here
and
i
listen
to
the
shovels
and
the
picks
against
that
wall
there.
and
i
pray
the
sun
will
come
up
at
the
curtains
before
they
break
through.
no,
i
don;t
pray
-
i
hope.
and
sometimes,
it
happens.
the
sun
beats
them.
but
mostly
the
shovels
beat
the
sun.
la-di-da-di,
we
like
to
party.
we
don;t
cause
trouble,
we
don;t
bother
nobody.
we;re
just
some
men
that;s
on
the
mic
and
when
we
rock
up
on
the
mic
we
rock
the
mic
(right).
for
all
of
y;all
keeping
y;all
in
health.
just
to
see
you
smile
and
enjoy
yourself
;cause
it;s
cool
when
you
;cause
a
cozy
condition,
that
we
create,
;cause
that;s
our
mission.
so
listen
to
what
we
say
because
this
type
of
shit,
it
happens
every
day.
some
people
think
they
can
outsmart
me.
maybe,
maybe.
i
have
yet
to
meet
one
that
can
outsmart
bullet.
your

is

is

all
you
care
about
is
the
stupid

you
don;t
care
about
me,
i
wanna
see
the

you
don;t

he
used
to
tell
her
everything,
and
she
used
to
listen
in
rapt
attention.
she
wondered
when
that
had
changed
and
who;d
lost
interest
first,
he
in
the
telling
or
she
in
the
listening.
i
used
to
know
how
the
mind
handled
language,
and
i
could
communicate
what
i
knew.
i
used
to
be
someone
who
knew
a
lot.
no
one
asks
for
my
opinion
or
advice
anymore.
i
miss
that.
i
used
to
be
curious
and
independent
and
confident.
i
miss
being
sure
of
things.
there;s
no
peace
in
being
unsure
of
everything
all
the
time.
i
miss
doing
everything
easily.
i
miss
being
a
part
of
what;s
happening.
i
miss
feeling
wanted.
i
miss
my
life
and
my
family.
i
loved
my
life
and
family.
my
yesterdays
are
disappearing,
and
my
tomorrows
are
uncertain,
so
what
do
i
live
for?
i
live
for
each
day.
i
live
in
the
moment.
some
tomorrow
soon,
i;ll
forget
that
i
stood
before
you
and
gave
this
speech.
but
just
because
i;ll
forget
it
some
tomorrow
doesn;t
mean
that
i
didn;t
live
every
second
of
it
today.
i
will
forget
today,
but
that
doesn;t
mean
that
today
doesn;t
matter.
and
i
have
no
control
over
which
yesterdays
i
keep
and
which
ones
get
deleted.
this
disease
will
not
be
bargained
with.
i
can;t
offer
it
the
names
of
the
us
presidents
in
exchange
for
the
names
of
my
children.
i
can;t
give
it
the
names
of
state
capitals
and
keep
the
memories
of
my
husband.
she
liked
being
reminded
of
butterflies.
she
remembered
being
six
or
seven
and
crying
over
the
fates
of
the
butterflies
in
her
yard
after
learning
that
they
lived
for
only
a
few
days.
her
mother
had
comforted
her
and
told
her
not
to
be
sad
for
the
butterflies,
that
just
because
their
lives
were
short
didn;t
mean
they
were
tragic.
watching
them
flying
in
the
warm
sun
among
the
daisies
in
their
garden,
her
mother
had
said
to
her,
see,
they
have
a
beautiful
life.
alice
liked
remembering
that.
crying
is
for
little
girls,
babies,
and
men
who
just
had
their
ears
ripped
off.
i
can;t
stand
the
thought
of
looking
at
you
someday,
this
face
i
love,
and
not
knowing
who
you
are.
now
when
an
american
has
an
idea,
he
directly
seeks
a
second
american
to
share
it.
if
there
be

they
elect
a
president
and
two
secretaries.
given
four,
they
name
a
keeper
of
records,
and
the
office
is
ready
for
work;
five,
they
convene
a
general
meeting,
and
the
club
is
fully
constituted.
i
don;t
wanna
be
"the
bee;s
knees".
i
don;t
wanna
be
any
kind
of
"knees"!
i
just
wanna
be
a
normal
girl,
with
normal
knees.
all
we
had
to
do,
was

there
once
was
a
tiger
striped
cat.
this
cat
died
a
million
deaths,
revived
and
lived
a
million
lives,
and
he
was
owned
by
various
people
who
he
didn;t
really
care
for.
the
cat
wasn;t
afraid
to
die.
then
one
day
the
cat
became
a
stray
cat,
which
meant
he
was
free.
he
met
a
white
female
cat,
and
the
two
of
them
spent
their
days
together
happily.
well,
years
passed,
and
the
white
cat
grew
weak
and
died
of
old
age.
the
tiger
striped
cat
cried
a
million
times,
and
then
he
died
too.
except
this
time,
he
didn;t
come
back
to
life.
when
you
spend
your
whole
life
living
under
a

idea
of

impossible

from
the
moment
i
understood
the
weakness
of
my
flesh,
it
disgusted
me.
i
craved
the
strength
and

of

i
aspired
to
the
purity

day
the

you
call
the
temple
will
wither,
and
you
will
beg
my
kind
to
save
you.

i
am
already
saved,

if
in

dream,
every
fiber
in
me
wants
to
shout
and
scream,
"stop!"
to
run
across
to
him,
take
him
in
my
arms,
to
tell
him
"i
love
you!
you
silly,
silly

i
love
you!"

instead
i
stand
still,

cracking.

sound
like

thinking

need
to
do
things
on
your
own
without
anyone;s

there
is
nothing
wrong
with
letting
the
people
who

do
i
take

by

through

dear
me
10
years
from
now,
if
you
still
feel
the
need
to
listen
to
this
again,
then
maybe
something
went
wrong?
or
did
you
change?
do
you
remember?
what
happened?
is
life
better,
or
worst?
it;s
never
too
late
to
try
and
fix
things.
right
now,
you;re
probably
wondering
how
i
felt
when
you
wrote
this.
well,
right
now,
i
guess
i
feel
like
i
don;t
have
a
lot
of
control
of
my
life,
but
it;s
exciting
nonetheless.
i;m
smart
and
handsome,
and
i
have
goals
to
work
toward.
so..
me
in
10
years
from
now,
if
you;re
reading
this
and
you
feel
like
things
haven;t
changed,
then
just
remember
that
it;s
never
too
late.
the
world
around
you
must
be
different
by
now,
but
it
doesn;t
mean
you
have
to
be.
stay
positive,
and
keep
doing
your
best.
i
would
burn
the
world
and
use
my
soul
for
tinder
to
hear
her
laugh
again.
if
the
world
is
ending,
a
woman
will
want
to
fix

if
the
world;s
ending,

will
take
the
time
to
tell
a
man
something
he;s
done
wrong.
how
do
i
take
off
a
mask
when
it
stops
being
a
mask,
when
it;s
as
much
a
part
of
me
as
i
am?
i;m
good
at
reading
people.
my
secret?
i
look
for
the
worst
in
them.
i
do
see
the
beauty
in
the
rules,
the
invisible
code
of
chaos
hiding
behind
the
menacing
face
of
order.
control
can
sometimes
be
an
illusion.
but
sometimes
you

gain

fantasy
is
an
easy
way
to
give
meaning
to
the
world.
to
cloak
our
harsh
reality
with
escapist
comfort.
after
all,
isn;t
that
why
we
surround
ourselves
with
so
many
screens?
so
we
can
avoid
seeing?
so
we
can
avoid
each
other?
so
we
can
avoid
truth?
the
world
itself;s
just
one
big
hoax.
spamming
each
other
with
our
running
commentary
of
bullshit,
masquerading
as
insight,
our
social
media
faking
as
intimacy.
or
is
it
that
we
voted
for
this?
not
with
our
rigged
elections,
but
with
our
things,
our
property,
our
money.
i;m
not
saying
anything
new.
we
all
know
why
we
do
this,
not
because
hunger
games
books
make
us
happy,
but
because
we
wanna
be
sedated.
because
it;s
painful
not
to
pretend,
because
we;re
cowards.
hello
friend.
hello
friend?
that;s
lame.
maybe
i
should
give
you
a
name.
but
that;s
a
slippery
slope,
you;re
only
in
my
head,
we
have
to
remember
that.
shit,
this
actually
happened,
i;m
talking
to
an
imaginary
person.
what
i;m
about
to
tell
you
is
top
secret.
a
conspiracy
bigger
than
all
of
us.
there;s
a
powerful
group
of
people
out
there
that
are
secretly
running
the
world.
i;m
talking
about
the
guys
no
one
knows
about,
the
ones
that
are
invisible.
the
top
1%
of
the
top
1%,
the
guys
that
play
god
without
permission.
and
now
i
think
they;re
following
me.
you;re
the
one
constant
in
a
sea
of
variables.
that;s
the
thing
about
deletion.
it;s
not
always
permanent.
there
are
many
reasons
you
want
to
recover
a
file
you
just
deleted.
where
you
have
that
moment
of
panic
where
it
hits
you,
where
that
thing
you
thought
had
no
value
suddenly
becomes
important.
where
you
suddenly
find
new
purpose
for
it.
give
a
man
a

he
can
rob
a

what
you
make

throws
at

and
if
it
throws
more
than
you;d
like,
more
than
you
think
you
can
handle?
well
then
you
just
have
to
find
the
heroism
within
yourself
and
play
out

hand
you;ve
been
dealt.
the
universe
never
sets
a
challenge

just

up
to
love
their
servitude
and
will
never
dream
of
revolution.
just
remember
that
sometimes,
the
way
you
think
about
a
person
isn;t
the
way
they
actually
are.
and
as
i
walked
back
to
give
takumi;s
note
to
the
colonel,
i
saw
that
i
would
never
know.
i
would
never
know
her
well
enough
to
know
her
thoughts
in
those
last
minutes,
would
never
know
if
she
left
us
on
purpose.
but
the
not-knowing
would
not
keep
me
from
caring,
and
i
would
always
love
alaska
young,
my
crooked
neighbor,
with
all
my
crooked
heart.
death
is

gives

your

are
numbered.
your

is
short.
we
never
lose
our
demons,
mordo.
we
only
learn
to
live
above
them.
we;ve
been
hired
to
stop
an
inter-dimensional
beast
from
feeding
on
those
batteries
and
i;m
going
to
stop
it
with
a
sword?
you;re
a
man
looking
at
the
world
through
a
keyhole,
and
you;ve
spent
your
whole
life
trying
to
widen
that
keyhole,
to
see
more,
to
know
more,
and
now,
on
hearing
that
it
can
be
widened,
in
ways
you
can;t
imagine
you
reject
the
possibility.
the
language
of
the
mystic
arts
is
as
old
as
civilization.
the
sorcerers
of
antiquity
called
the
use
of
this
language
spells.
but
if
that
word
offends
your
modern
sensibilities
you
can
call
it
a
program,
the
source
code
that
shapes
reality.
we
harness
energy
drawn
from
other
dimensions
of
the
multiverse
to
cast
spells
to
conjure
shields
and
weapons
to
make
magic.
when
you;re
building
a
videogame
world
you;re
building
with
ideas,
and
that
can
be
like
working
with
quick-set
cement.
you
mold
your
ideas
into
a
certain
shape
that
can
be
played
with,
and
in
the
process
of
playing
with
them
they
begin
to
harden
and
set
until
they;re
immutable,
like
rock.
at
that
point
you
can;t
change
the
world
-
not
without
breaking
it
into
pieces
and
starting
fresh
with
new
ideas.
and
then
keshpeth
led
his
army
of
ten
thousand
into
the
realm
beyond
the
clouds,
and
they
did
do
battle
with
the
devourer,
may
his
name
be
forever
unremembered.
and
then
keshpeth
and
his
ten
thousand
did
craft
seven
cunning
chains
out
of
the
bones
of
jaspetar,
seventh
bride
of
the
dread
devourer,
may
his
name
be
forever
unremembered,
and
bound
him
within
the
pearl
of
the
father
of
oysters,
he
who
dwells
under
the
mirror
of
salt
in
the
realm
under
the
sea.
and
keshpeth
ordered
that
the
gates
to
the
far
country
be
sealed
forever,
lest
the
dread
devourer,
may
his
name
be
forever
unremembered,
find
its
way
back
to
our
world.
for
those
who
are
not
aware
of
our
existence,
we
represent
the
organization
known
as
the
scp
foundation.
our
previous
mission
centered
around
the
containment
and
study
of
anomalous
objects,
entities,
and
other
assorted
phenomena.
this
mission
was
the
focus
of
our
organization
for
more
than
one
hundred
years.
due
to
circumstances
outside
of
our
control,
this
directive
has
now
changed.
our
new
mission
will
be
the
extermination
of
the
human
race.
there
will
be
no
further
communication.
a
group
of
young
erusian
officers
have
taken
over
megalith,
the
superweapon
that
was
under
development.
megalith
is
a
rocket
launch
facility
that
can
shoot
down
asteroid
fragments
in
orbit.
the
only
way
to
destroy
this
dangerous
and
highly
fortified
facility
is
to
hit
it
from
the
inside.

the
missile
port
grooves
to
find
the
three
generators
deep
within
the
facility.
destroy
the
generators
to
access
the
central
heat
vent.
once
inside,
destroy
the
giant
missile
in
the
central
silo.
an
infiltration
unit
will
secure
your
escape
route.
their
plan
calls
for
waiting
until
the
generators
are
offline,
and
then
taking
over
the
sub
control
room
once
the
blackout
hits.
enter
this
rat;s
nest
with
full
confidence
that
the
unit
will
get
you
out
again.
it;s
highly
likely
that
this
will
be
your
final

we
need
heroes
after
the

have
you
ever
had
a
dream,
neo,
that
you
seemed
so
sure
it
was
real?
but
if
were
unable
to
wake
up
from
that
dream,
how
would
you
tell
the
difference
between
the
dream

&
the
real
world?
if
you
ain;t
scared...
you
ain;t
human.
it;s
kind
of
hard
to
ask
a
dead
guy
what
he
did
wrong.
i
promised
i;d
save
him,
take
him
home!
i
promised
him!
maybe
you
should
just
press
the

i
just...feel
like
i
need
to
save
everyone.
to
redeem
myself.
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
shut
the
f***
up.
going
outside
is
highly
overrated.
no
one
in
the
world
gets
what
they
want
and
that
is
beautiful.
you;d
be
amazed
how
much
research
you
can
get
done
when
you
have
no
life
whatsoever.
being
human
totally
sucks
most
of
the
time.
videogames
are
the
only
thing
that
make
life
bearable.
you;re
probably
wondering
what;s
going
to
happen
to
you.
that;s
easy.
the
same
thing
is
going
to
happen
to
you
that
has
happened
to
every
other
human
being
who
has
ever
lived.
you;re
going
to
die.
we
all
die.
that;s
just
how
it
is.
for
a
bunch
of
hair-less
apes,
we;ve
actually
managed
to
invent
some
pretty
incredible
things.
i
was
watching
a
collection
of
vintage
;80s
cereal
commercials
when
i
paused
to
wonder
why
cereal
manufacturers
no
longer
included
toy
prizes
inside
every
box.
it
was
a
tragedy,
in
my
opinion.
another
sign
that
civilization
was
going
straight
down
the
tubes.
my
friend
kira
always
said
that
life
is
like
an
extremely
difficult,
horribly
unbalanced
video
game.
when
you;re
born,
you;re
given
a
randomly
generated
character,
with
a
randomly
determined
name,
race,
face,
and
social
class.
your
body
is
your
avatar,
and
you
spawn
in
a
random
geographic
location,
at
a
random
moment
in
human
history,
surrounded
by
a
random
group
of
people,
and
then
you
have
to
try
to
survive
for
as
long
as
you
can.
sometimes
the
game
might
seem
easy.
even
fun.
other
times
it
might
be
so
difficult
you
want
to
give
up
and
quit.
but
unfortunately,
in
this
game
you
only
get
one
life.
when
your
body
grows
too
hungry
or
thirsty
or
ill
or
injured
or
old,
your
health
meter
runs
out
and
then
it;s
game
over.
some
people
play
the
game
for
a
hundred
years
without
ever
figuring
out
that
it;s
a
game,
or
that
there
is
a
way
to
win
it.
to
win
the
videogame
of
life
you
just
have
to
try
to
make
the
experience
of
being
forced
to
play
it
as
pleasant
as
possible,
for
yourself,
and
for
all
of
the
other
players
you
encounter
in
your
travels.
kira
says
that
if
everyone
played
the
game
to
win,
it;d
be
a
lot
more
fun
for
everyone.
human
beings
were
never
meant
to
participate
in
a
worldwide
social
network
comprised
of
billions
of
people.
we
were
designed
by
evolution
to
be
hunter-gatherers,
with
the
mental
capacity
to
interact
and
socialize
with
the
other
members
of
our
tribe
-
a
tribe
made
up
of
a
few
hundred
other
people
at
most.
interacting
with
thousands
or
even
millions
of
other
people
on
a
daily
basis
was
way
too
much
for
our
ape-descended
melons
to
handle.
that
was
why
social
media
had
been
gradually
driving
the
entire
population
of
the
world
insane
since
it
emerged
back
around
the
turn
of
the
century.
everybody
wants
to
rule
the
world.
how
the
f***
do
you
negotiate
with
a
piece
of
software?
the
world;s
population
was
fast
approaching
ten
billion
people,
and
mother
earth
was
making
it
abundantly
clear
that
she
could
no
longer
sustain
all
of
us.

are

am

to
society.
man
do
i
have
fun!
you
still
have
a
lot
of
time
to
make
yourself
be
what
you
want.
there;s
still
lots
of
good
in
the
world.

dally.
i
don;t
think
he
knows.
you
have
only
one
life,
make
the
most
of
it.
nothing
in
life
is
easy,
but
that;s
no
reason
to
give
up.
you;ll
be
surprised
what
you
can
accomplish
when
you
set
your
mind
to
it.
you
may
have
done
some
bad
things,
but
that
doesn;t
mean
you;re
a
bad
kid.
don;t
ask
for
guarantees.
and
don;t
look
to
be
saved
in
any
one
thing,
person,
machine,
or

do
your
own
bit
of
saving,
and
if
you
drown,
at
least
die
knowing
you
were
headed
for
shore.
i
still
love
books.
nothing
a
computer
can
do
can
compare
to
a
book.
you
can;t
really
put
a
book
on
the
internet.
three
companies
have
offered
to
put
books
by
me
on
the
net,
and
i
said,
;if
you
can
make
something
that
has
a
nice
jacket,
nice
paper
with
that
nice
smell,
then
we;ll
talk.;
all
the
computer
can
give
you
is
a
manuscript.
people
don;t
want
to
read
manuscripts.
they
want
to
read
books.
books
smell
good.
they
look
good.
you
can
press
it
to
your
bosom.
you
can
carry
it
in
your
pocket.
it
was
a
pleasure
to
burn.
i
don;t
talk
things,
sir.
i
talk
the
meaning
of
things.
our
civilization
is
flinging
itself
to
pieces.

as
if
you;d

have
you
ever
watched
the
jet
cars
race
on
the
boulevard?...i
sometimes
think
drivers
don;t
know
what
grass
is,
or
flowers,
because
they
never
see
them
slowly...if
you
showed
a
driver
a
green
blur,
oh
yes!
he;d
say,
that;s
grass!
a
pink
blur!
that;s
a
rose

blurs
are
cows.
my
father
picked
me
up
from
school
one
day
and
we
played
hookey
and
went
to
the
beach.
it
was
too
cold
to
go
in
the
water
so
we
sat
on
a
blanket
and
ate
pizza.
when
i
got
home
my
sneakers
were
full
of
sand
and
i
dumped
it
on
my
bedroom
floor.
i
didn;t
know
the
difference,
i
was
six.
my
mother
screamed
at
me
for
the
mess
but
he
wasn;t
mad.
he
said
that
billions
of
years
ago
the
world;s
shifting
and
ocean
moving
brought
that
sand
to
that
spot
on
the
beach
and
then
i
took
it
away.
every
day
he
said
we
change
the
world.
which
is
a
nice
thought
until
i
think
about
how
many
days
and
lifetimes
i
would
need
to
bring
a
shoe
full
of
sand
home
until
there
is
no
beach.
until
it
made
a
difference
to
anyone.
every
day
we
change
the
world.
but
to
change
the
world
in
a
way
that
means
anything
that
takes
more
time
than
most
people
have.
it
never
happens
all
at
once.
it;s
slow.
it;s
methodical.
it;s
exhausting.
we
don;t
all
have
the
stomach
for
it.
hello.
it;s
me,
choromatsu.
i;m
currently
in
egypt.
i
heard
that
pieces
of
shit
were
more
popular,
so
i
tried
being
one,
and...
i
was
arrested.
i;m
scared.
i
didn;t
want
to
be
held
prisoner
by
anything
anymore,
so
i
left
japan,
and
now
i;m
literally
a
prisoner.
life;s
pretty
funny
isn;t
it?
but
some
good
things
came
out
of
this.
i
don;t
have
time
to
think
about
anything
other
than
eating,
going
to
the
bathroom,
and
sleeping,
so
i
don;t
let
the
little
things
get
me
down.
there;s
no
envy,
no
self-loathing,
and
no
hope.
and
because
there;s
no
hope,
i;m
in
a
lovely
state
where
there;s
also
no
despair.
i
don;t
know
how
much
happier
i
am
being
a
prisoner
physically
versus
being
one
mentally,
but
the
fact
that
i;m
thinking
this
way
might
be
a
sign
that
i;m
still
a
prisoner.
i
shouldn;t
feel
trapped,
but
i
do,
but
i
also
feel
trapped
by
the
fact
that
i
don;t
feel
trapped
over
feeling
trapped.
what
the
hell
am
i
even
saying?
i
feel
like
i
might
go
insane.
anyway
i;m
going
to
try
to
live
life
without
being
held
prisoner
by
anyone.

she
had
cancer
instead.
she;d
trade
alzheimer;s
for
cancer

she
felt
ashamed
for
wishing
this,
and
it
was
certainly
a
pointless
bargaining,
but
she
permitted
herself
the
fantasy
anyway.
with
cancer,
she;d
have
something
to
fight.
there
was
surgery,
radiation,
and
chemotherapy.
there
was
the
chance
that
she
could
win.
her
family
and
the
community
at
harvard
would
rally
behind
her
battle
and
consider
it
noble.
and
even
if
it
defeated
her
in
the
end,
she;d
be
able
to
look
them
knowingly
in

eye
and

she

about

why
are
you
still

you

and
you

crap
already,
right?
hey,
you
listening
to
me?
he
never
wanted
to
join
the

even
when
i
told
him
how
rich
he
could
get,
he
wouldn;t
even
think
about
it.
it
was
stupid
how
damn
straight-laced
he
was.
but
you...
you
drove
him
crazy.
and
you
killed
him.
he;d
never
even
been
with
a
woman...
how
is
it
right
that
you
live
and
he
dies!?
hey,
are
you
listening!?
we;re
all
afraid,
you
know...
to
get
up
on
the
stage.
maybe
you
will
mess
up.
maybe
they;ll
totally
reject
you.
even
so,
you
grit
your
teeth
and
get
up
on
the
stage
anyway.

lump
of

seeing
the

as
you

swing
between

and
despair
at
your
slightest
gesture,
and
my
heart
starts
to
play
a
melody.
what
kind
of
feeling
is
this
again?
what
do
they
call
this
kind
of
feeling?
i
think
it;s
probably...
called
love.
i;m
sure
this
is
what
they
call
love.

human
beings
do
not
survive
on
bread
alone
...
but
on
the
nourishments
of
liberty.
for
what
indeed
is
a
man
without
freedom
...
naught
but
a
mechanism,
trapped
in
the
cogwheels
of
eternity.
your
will
to
survive,
your
love
of
life,
your
passion
to
know
...
everything
that
is
truest
and
best
in
all
species
of
beings
has
been
revealed
to
you.
those
are
the
qualities
that
make
a
civilization
worthy
to
survive.
now,
i
don;t
pretend
to
tell
you
how
to
find
happiness
and
love,
when
every
day
is
a
struggle
to
survive.
but
i
do
insist
that
you
do
survive,
because
the
days
and
the
years
ahead
are
worth
living
for!
with
the
first
link,
the
chain
is
forged.
the
first
speech
censored,
the
first
thought
forbidden,
the
first
freedom
denied,
chains
us
all
irrevocably.
our
species
can
only
survive
if
we
have
obstacles
to
overcome.
you
remove
those
obstacles.
without
them
to
strengthen
us,
we
will
weaken
and
die.
you
know
the
greatest
danger
facing
us
is
ourselves,
and
irrational
fear
of
the
unknown.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
unknown.
only
things
temporarily
hidden,
temporarily
not
understood.
you
may
find
that
having
is
not
so
pleasing
a
thing
as
wanting.
this
is
not
logical,
but
it
is
often
true.
he
taught
me
that
being
born
with
natural
talent
is
not
the
greatest
gift.
the
truly
lucky
ones
are
those
with
an
unwavering
belief
in
themselves.
and
the
passion
to
keep
striving
to
the
very
end.
i
cannot
believe
this
shit!
first
i
get
a
bullshit
assignment,
now
mr.
rice-a-roni
don;t
even
speak
american.
c;mon,
man,
my
ride
over
here.
put
your
bag
in
the
back.
it;s
like
how
hot
dogs
come
in
packs
of
10,
and
buns
come
in
packs
of
eight
or
12;
you
have
to
buy
nine
packs
to
make
it
come
out
even.
physical
wounds
will
definitely
bleed
and
may
look
painful
but
over
time
they
heal
by
themselves
and
if
you
apply
medicine,
they
will
heal
faster.
what;s
troublesome
are
wounds
of
the
heart.
nothing
is
harder
to
heal.
they;re
a
bit
different
from
physical
injuries.
you
can;t
apply
medicine
for
one
thing
and
sometimes,
they
never
heal.
there;s
only
one
cure
for
a
wound
of
the
heart.
it;s
a
bit
bothersome
and
you
can
only
receive
it
from
someone
else.
what
is
it?
love.
normally,
i
don;t
condone
leaving
early,
but
i
have
an
appointment
with
the
horse
doctor.
how
that
horse
became
a
doctor,
i
don;t
know.\n
no,
i;m
kidding.
he;s
just
a
regular
doctor...
who
shoots
your
horse
in
the
head
when
its
leg
is
broken.
this
is
me!
up
to
now,
you
still
don;t
even
see
me
for
who
i
really
am!
i;m
you,
dad.
i
tried
to
give
you
one
last
chance,
like
you
said
with
breeze,
but
you;re
in
the
way.
you;re
in
the
way
of
my
future,
like
you
said
he
was
in
the
way
of
yours.
ain;t
that
what
you
said?
in
the
way
of
your
future
right?
put
the
gun
down.
tariq,
if
you
do
this,
you
can
never
go
back.
i;ll
do
anything
to
go
back,
to
go
back
to
how
it
was
before
you
left
us
for
angela.
i
just
can;t,
it;s
too
late.
mental?
well,
let
me
tell
you
something,
mr.
100%
tip-top
mental.
my
daughter
may
be
no
spring
chicken,
and
her
jaw
may
crack
when
she
chews,
and
she
may
have
noticeable
trouble
digesting
raw
vegetables.
but
one
thing
she
is
not,
is
mental!
picture
this.
two
young
girls,
best
friends,
who
share
three
things:
some
dough
and
a
dream.
everything
is
going
great,
until
one
day,
a
fast-talking
pepperoni
salesman
gallops
into
town.
of
course,
both
girls
are
impressed.
he
dates
one
one
night,
and
the
other
the
next
night.
pretty
soon,
he
drives
a
wedge
between
them.
before
you
know
it,
the
pizza
suffers,
the
business
suffers,
the
friendship
suffers.
the
girls
part
company
and
head
for
america,
never
to
see
one
another
again.
rose,
one
of
those
girls
was
me.
the
other
one,
you
probably
know
as
mama
celeste.
no,
blanche.
i;m
not
going
to
let
you
do
that.
i;ve
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking.
if,
after
all
the
years
of
love
and
companionship,
fernando
and
i
are
meant
to
part
company,
i;ll
just
have
to
accept
that.
time
to
time,
life
deals
you
an
unfriendly
hand;
there;s
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
i
guess
there;s
a
lesson
to
be
learned
here.
sometimes
life
just
isn;t
fair,
kiddo.
the
most
romantic
thing
was
when
stan
proposed.
i
went
to
the
powder
room,
and
when
i
returned
to
the
table,
there
was
an
open
bottle
of
dom
perignon
and
two
filled
glasses.
we
clinked
the
glasses
in
a
toast
and
stan
gave
me
a
coy
smile,
and
i
winked
at
him
and
i
just
downed
the
champagne
in
one
gulp.
and
it
didn;t
go
down
smoothly.
later,
stan
told
me
that
he
put
my
engagement
ring
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass.
the
serum
amplifies
everything
that
is
inside,
so
good
becomes
great;
bad
becomes
worse.
this
is
why
you
were
chosen.
because
the
strong
man
who
has
known
power
all
his
life,
may
lose
respect
for
that
power,
but
a
weak
man
knows
the
value
of
strength,
and
knows
compassion.
i
don;t
want
to
kill
anyone.
i
don;t
like
bullies;
i
don;t
care
where
they;re
from.
let
me
tell
you
a
story.
picture
it:
sicily,
1922.
an
attractive
peasant
girl
who
has
saved
her
lira
embarks
on
a
glorious
vacation
to
a
crimean
resort
on
the
black
sea.
for
weeks,
she
frolics
at
the
seaside
resorts,
and
enjoys
the
company
of
many
young
men,
all
of
whom
adore
her.
when
it;s
time
to
return
to
sicily,
three
different
suitors
beg
her
to
stay.
but
she
can;t
decide
who
to
choose,
so
she
chooses
none
of
them.
but
she
agrees
to
meet
with
them
at
the
same
resort
many
years
later.
to
her
trio
of
suitors,
that
eventful
gathering
was
referred
to
as
"rendezvous
with
sophia."
but
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
it
was
better
known
as
the
yalta
conference.
i;m
not
gonna
kill
myself
because
if
my
depression
wants
me
dead
that
badly
it;s
gonna
have
to
start
shutting
my
organs
down
like
a
real
disease
instead
of
being
a
coward
and
hiding
in
my
brain
and
trying
to
get
me
to
do
it;s
dirty
work
for
it!
human
touch.
our
first
form
of
communication.
safety,
security,
comfort,
all
in
the
gentle
caress
of
a
finger.
or
the
brush
of
lips
on
a
soft
cheek.
it
connects
us
when
we;re
happy,
bolsters
us
in
times
of
fear,
excites
us
in
times
of
passion
and
love.
we
need
that
touch
from
the
one
we
love,
almost
as
much
as
we
need
air
to
breathe.
but
i
never
understood
the
importance
of
touch.
his
touch.
until
i
couldn;t
have
it.
so
if
you;re
watching
this,
and
you;re
able,
touch
him.
touch
her.
life;s
too
short
to
waste
a
second.
tom,
don;t
let
anybody
kid
you.
it;s
all
personal,
every
bit
of
business.
every
piece
of
shit
every
man
has
to
eat
every
day
of
his
life
is
personal.
they
call
it
business.
ok.
but
it;s
personal
as
hell.
you
know
where
i
learned
that
from?
the
don.
my
old
man.
the
godfather.
if
a
bolt
of
lightning
hit
a
friend
of
his
the
old
man
would
take
it
personal.
he
took
my
going
into
the
marines
personal.
that;s
what
makes
him
great.
the
great
don.
he
takes
everything
personal
like
god.
he
knows
every
feather
that
falls
from
the
tail
of
a
sparrow
or
however
the
hell
it
goes?
right?
and
you
know
something?
accidents
don;t
happen
to
people
who
take
accidents
as
a
personal
insult.
one
of
the
main
differences
between
introverts
and
extroverts
is
that
extroverts
get
their
energy
from
hanging
out
with
other
people,
and
introverts
aren;t
mentally
ill.
unfortunately,
my
birthday
has
always
been
the
lousiest
day
of
the
year.
it
all
began
on
the
day
of
my
actual
birth...
both
of
my
parents
failed
to
show
up.
by
the
age
of
5,
i
was
forced
to
throw
my
own
surprise
party
at
gunther
goat
cheese;s:
the
goat-cheesiest
place
in
all
of
drusselstein.
many
of
my
closest
friends
were
there:
count
wolfgang,

betty
the
she-boar,
ratputin,
and
the
licekins,
olga
and
chicago
joe.
but
one
should
never
walk
the
paths
of
drusselstein
with
uncovered
doonkleberry
cake,
lest
the
doonkleberry
bats
swarm.
i
believe
there;s
a
hero
in
all
of
us
that
keeps
us
honest,
gives
us
strength,
makes
us
noble,
and
finally
allows
us
to
die
with
pride,
even
though
sometimes
we
have
to
be
steady
and
give
up
the
things
we
want
the
most,
even
our
dreams.
i
play
russian
roulette
every
day,
a
man;s
sport
with
the
bullet
called
life.
yeah,
mama
called
life.
yeah
and
every
time
i
try
to
go
where
i
really
want
to
be,
it;s
already
where
i
am,
;cause
i;m
already
there!
back
in
gimmelshtump
in
the
days
of
my
youth,
the
doofenshmirtzes
were
a
proud
family.
but
those
were
lean
times
for
my
father,
and
our
beloved
lawn
gnome
was
repossessed.
who
would
protect
our
zatzenfruit
garden
from
those
witches,
spells,
and
wood
trolls?
from
a
tender
age,
my
father
decided
that
it
would
be
me.
while
the
other
children
played
kick-the-shtumpel
and
ate
doonkelberries,
i
would
stand
for
hours.
all
through
the
cold
night
as
the
spitzenhound
howled,
my
only
companion
was
the
moon.
and
my
neighbor
kenny.
and
since
my
lawn
gnome
was
taken
away
from
me,
i
will
destroy
every
lawn
gnome
in
the
entire
tri-state
area!

hours
in

a
good
rule
to
follow
is
to
form
the
embouchure
so
that
all
the
muscles
around
the
aperture
are
working
in
unison.
picture
a
fireman;s
net
-
the
center
being
the
aperture
of
your
embouchure.
around
this
net
are
eight
firemen
pulling
out
from
the
center
to
keep
the
net
taut.
think
of
your
muscles
working
in
this
same
way
to
preserve
the
stability
and
openness
of
the
aperture.
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
area
just
below
the
bottom
lip,
the
goal
being
to
have
as
little
movement
as
possible
and
to
maintain
a
flat
chin.
in
addition,
try
to
form
your
embouchure
away
from
the
mouthpiece
and
the
instrument.
a
good
brass
player
knows
how
to
do
this.
assist

allows
you
to
modify
the

rules
to
fit
your
specific
needs.
this
includes
options
such
as
slowing
the
game

granting
yourself
invincibility
or
infinite
stamina,
and
skipping

entirely.
celeste

intended
to
be
a
challenging
and
rewarding

if
the

that
you
can
still
find
that

with

when
i
was
young,
i
entered
a
science
fair
with
my
very
first
inator.
i
wasn;t
very
clever
with
the
names
yet.
it
was
just,
you
know,
"inator."
just
as
i
was
about
to
demonstrate
my
invention
to
the
judges,
a
kid
with
a
baking
soda
volcano
stole
the
show!
the
next
year
i
tried
again
with
my
even-bigger-inator.
and
again,
my
thunder
was
stolen
by
a
baking
soda
volcano!
i
had
enough
of
science.
i
decided
to
devote
my
life
to
poetry
instead.
yet
curiously,
i
still
lost
to
a
baking
soda
volcano!
back
in
gimmelshtump,
in
the
depths
of
my
childhood,
my
parents
were
expecting
a
brand
new
baby
girl.
my
mother
spent
months
knitting
pretty
dresses.
unfortunately
the
baby
turned
out
to
be
a
boy,
and
because
we
were
out
of
material,
i
was
forced
to
wear
those
same
dresses
for
an
entire
year,
drawing
mockery
and
scorn
from
all
of
my
manly
classmates!
wonder
if
i
gave
an
oreo
to
the
big
bad
wolf.
how
would
the
story
go?
would
he
still
go
huff
and
puff?
or
would
he
bring
those
pigs
cool
stuff
to
decorate
the
deck
he
helped
them
build?
would
they
not
get
killed?
wonder
if
i
gave
an
oreo
to
a
vampire
in
a
creepy
show.
would
he
not
act
so
undead?
would
he
thirst
for
milk
instead?
i;ve
just
got
this
feeling
that
it
might
work
out
all
right.
;cause

if
i
gave

to
great
white
sharks,
would
they
share

with

would
they
call
up

giant
squid
for
a
friendly
meal?
i;m
not
the
sweet,
forebearing
guy
that
i
try
to
make
out
that
i
am.
i
get
irritated
at
things.
i
feel
like
snapping
at
people,
and
i
feel
like
being
selfish
at
times;
and
i
don;t
know
why
i
should
pretend
i;m
not
that
way.
we
as
a
nation
are
slowly
realizing
our
enormous
strength,
and
the
power
and
responsibility
which
go
with
that
strength.
we
are
moving,
somewhat
ignorantly
and
clumsily,
toward
accepting
a
position
of
responsible
world
leadership.
we
make
many
mistakes.
we
are
often
inconsistent.
we
are
far
from
perfect.
we
are
deeply
frightened
by
the
strength
of

view
of

from

own.

i
have
little
sympathy
with
the
rather
prevalent
concept
that
man
is
basically
irrational,
and
that
his
impulses,
if
not
controlled,
will
lead
to
destruction
of
others
and
self.
man;s
behavior
is
exquisitely
rational,
moving
with
subtle
and
ordered
complexity
toward
the
goals
his
organism
is
endeavoring
to
achieve.
the
tragedy
for
most
of
us
is
that
our
defenses
keep
us
from
being
aware
of
this
rationality,
so
that
conciously
we
are
moving
in
one
direction,
while
organismically
we
are
moving
in
another.
often
the
learnings
take
such
simple
forms
as
"i
am
different
from
others";
"i
do
feel
hatred
for
him";
"i
am
fearful
of
feeling
dependent";
"i
do
feel
sorry
for
myself";
"i
am
self-centered";
"i
do
have
tender
and
loving
feelings";
"i
could
be
what
i
want
to
be";
etc.
but
in
spite
of
their
seeming
simplicity
these
learnings
are
vastly
significant
in
some
new
way
which
is
very
difficult
to
define.
we
can
think
of
it
in
various
ways.
they
are
self-appropriated
learnings,
for
one
thing,
based
somehow
in
experience,
not
in
symbols.
how
can
you
know
that
this
account,
or
any
account

how
do
you
know
that
it
has
any
relationship
to

if
we
are
to
rely
on
this
inner
and
subjective
experience
as
being
the
truth
about
human

or
about
ways
of
altering

then
yogi,
christian
science,
dianetics,
and
the
delusions
of
a
psychotic
individual
who
believes
himself
to
be
jesus

are
all
true,
just
as
true
as
this
account.
it
is
those
who

are
the
greatest

history
has
shown
us
this.
you
could
say
that
this
is
the
final
warning
from

those
who

remembering
something
that
no

can
is
a
painful
thing.
you
can;t
talk
to
anyone
about

no
one
will

you;ll
be

no

why
its

let;s
go
to
a
place,
where
everything
is
made
of
blocks.
with
the
only
limit,
is
your
imagination.
let;s
go,
whereever
you
wanna
go.
climb
the
tallest
mountains,
venture
down
to
the
darkest
caves.
build
anything
you
want,
day
or
night,
rain
or
shine.
;cause
this
is
the
most
significant
sandbox
you;ll
ever
set
foot
in.
build
a
majestic
castle,
invent
a
new
machine,
or
take
a
ride
on
a
rollercoaster.
play
with
friends,
build
your
own
little
community,
protect
yourself
with
the
strongest
armour
that
you
can
craft,
and
fight
off
the
dangers
of
the
night.
no

can

you
what

this
adventure,
it;s
up
to
you.
for
a
brief
stint
in
high
school,
scout
joined
the
track
team
in
one
of
his
many
schemes
to
pick
up
girls.
he
was
kicked
off
the
team
after
three
when
everyone
realized
he
was
23-years-old
and
also
not
enrolled
in
school.
the
industrial
revolution
and
its
consequences
have
been
a
disaster
for
the
human
race.
they
have
greatly
increased
the
life-expectancy
of
those
of
us
who
live
in
"advanced"
countries,
but
they
have
destabilized
society,
have
made
life
unfulfilling,
have
subjected
human
beings
to
indignities,
have
led
to
widespread
psychological
suffering
(in
the
third
world
to
physical
suffering
as
well)
and
have
inflicted
severe
damage
on
the
natural
world.
the
continued
development
of
technology
will
worsen
the
situation.
it
will
certainly
subject
human
beings
to
greater
indignities
and
inflict
greater
damage
on
the
natural
world,
it
will
probably
lead
to
greater
social
disruption
and
psychological
suffering,
and
it
may
lead
to
increased
physical
suffering
even
in
"advanced"
countries.
hey
look,
buddy,
i;m
an
engineer.
that
means
i
solve
problems.
not
problems
like
"what
is
beauty?",
because
that
would
fall
within
the
purview
of
your
conundrums
of
philosophy.
i
solve
practical
problems.
fr;instance,
how
am
i
going
to
stop
some
big
mean
mother
hubbard
from
tearing
me
a
structurally
superfluous
new
behind?
the
answer:
use
a
gun,
and
if
that
don;t
work,
use
more
gun.
like
this
heavy
caliber,
tripod-mounted,
little
ol;
number
designed
by
me,
built
by
me,
and
you;d
best
hope...
not

throughout
the
galaxy
a
legend
is
told,
on
a
distant
planet
a
grim
fortress
stood,
until
a
deadly
force
parted
the
heavens
and
descended
upon
the
keep.
though
brought
to
ruin,
the
ashes
of
that
place
hold
an
artifact
of
impossible
power
-
a
gun
that
can
kill
the
past.
over
time
the
fortress
was
rebuilt,
and
some
who
hear
the
legend
would
risk
everything
for
another
shot
-
to
claim
their
prize
and
make
what
was
done,
undone
they
must
-
enter
the
gungeon.
you
don;t
want
to
go
for
realism,
you
can
go
for
better
than
realism.
what
do
you
mean
better
than
realism?
how
about
an
elephant
with
blue
eyes.
you
happen
upon
a
group
of
what
looks
like
purple
fire
spirits
dancing
around
a
large
bonfire.
the
spirits
toss
small
bones
and
fragments
into
the
fire,
which
brilliantly
erupts
each
time.
as
you
approach,
the
spirits
all
turn
to
you,
expectantly...
you
don;t
remember
me?
i;ll
give
you
a
clue...
does
april
the
3rd
mean
anything
to
you?
i
believe
that
was
the
day
of
our
first
encounter.
you
look
like
you
might
be
remembering
something...
remind
yourself
that
overconfidence
is
a
slow
and
insidious
killer.
you
feel
an
evil
presence
watching
you...
the
ancient
spirits
of
light
and
dark
have
been
released.
there;s
something
very
strange
about
this
place...
the
layout
seems
to
change
all
the
time.
i;ve
never
seen
the
same
room
twice!
greetings!
my
name
is
yang,
and
this
is
my
journal.
dusty
maps
and

of
amazing

led
me
here,
deep
under

we

we

is
the
highest
form
of
research.
we
can
only
see
a
short
distance
ahead,
but
we
can
see
plenty
there
that
needs
to
be
done.
our
greatest
weakness
lies
in
giving
up.
the
most
certain
way
to
succeed
is
always
to
try
just
one
more
time.
you
are
never
too
old
to
set

or
to
dream

new

it
is
not
the
strongest
of
the
species
that

nor
the
most
intelligent,
but
the
one
most
responsive
to
change.
you
can,
you
should,
and
if
you;re
brave
enough
to
start,
you
will.
we
know
what
we
are,
but
not
what
we
may
be.
the
work
of
today
is
the
history
of
tomorrow,
and
we
are
its
makers.
pain
is
inevitable.
suffering
is
optional.
the
greatest
enemy
of
knowledge
is
not
ignorance,
it
is
the
illusion
of
knowledge.
we
may
encounter
many
defeats,
but
we
must
not
be
defeated.
perseverance
is
failing
19
times

there

the
stairs.

i;m
selfish,
impatient
and
a
little
insecure.
i
make
mistakes,
i
am
out
of

and
at
times
hard
to

but
if
you
can;t
handle
me
at
my
worst,
then
you
sure
as
hell
don;t

two
things
are
infinite:
the

the
change
that
you

to
see
in

world.
in
three
words
i
can
sum
up
everything
i;ve
learned
about
life:
it
goes
on.
i;ve
learned
that
people
will
forget
what
you
said,
people
will
forget
what
you
did,
but
people
will
never
forget
how
you
made
them
feel.
always
forgive
your
enemies;
nothing
annoys
them
so
much.
live
as
if
you
were
to
die
tomorrow.
learn
as
if
you
were
to
live
forever.
here;s
to
the
crazy
ones.
the
misfits.
the
rebels.
the
troublemakers.
the
round
pegs
in
the
square
holes.
the
ones
who
see
things
differently.
they;re
not
fond
of
rules.
and
they
have
no
respect
for
the
status
quo.
you
can
quote
them,
disagree
with
them,
glorify
or
vilify
them.
about
the
only
thing
you
can;t
do
is
ignore
them.
because
they
change
things.
they
push
the
human
race
forward.
and
while
some
may
see
them
as
the
crazy
ones,
we
see
genius.
because
the
people
who
are
crazy
enough
to
think
they
can
change
the
world,
are
the
ones
who
do.
i
believe
that
everything
happens
for
a
reason.
people
change
so
that
you
can
learn
to
let
go,
things
go
wrong
so
that
you
appreciate
them
when
they;re
right,
you
believe
lies
so
you
eventually
learn
to
trust
no
one
but
yourself,
and
sometimes
good
things
fall
apart
so
better
things
can
fall
together.
only
once
in
your
life,
i
truly
believe,
you
find
someone
who
can
completely
turn
your
world
around.
you
tell
them
things
that
you;ve
never
shared
with
another
soul
and
they
absorb
everything
you
say
and
actually
want
to
hear
more.
you
share
hopes
for
the
future,
dreams
that
will
never
come
true,
goals
that
were
never
achieved
and
the
many
disappointments
life
has
thrown
at
you.
when
something
wonderful
happens,
you
can;t
wait
to
tell
them
about
it,
knowing
they
will
share
in
your
excitement.
they
are
not
embarrassed
to
cry
with
you
when
you
are
hurting
or
laugh
with
you
when
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself.
never
do
they
hurt
your
feelings
or
make
you
feel
like
you
are
not
good
enough,
but
rather
they
build
you
up
and
show
you
the
things
about
yourself
that
make
you
special
and
even
beautiful.
there
is
never
any
pressure,
jealousy
or
competition
but
only
a
quiet
calmness
when
they
are
around.
you
can
be
yourself
and
not
worry
about
what
they
will
think
of
you
because
they
love
you
for
who
you
are.
the
things
that
seem
insignificant
to
most
people
such
as
a
note,
song
or
walk
become
invaluable
treasures
kept
safe
in
your
heart
to
cherish
forever.
memories
of
your
childhood
come
back
and
are
so
clear
and
vivid
it;s
like
being
young
again.
colours
seem
brighter
and
more
brilliant.
laughter
seems
part
of
daily
life
where
before
it
was
infrequent
or
didn;t
exist
at
all.
a
phone
call
or
two
during
the
day
helps
to
get
you
through
a
long
day;s
work
and
always
brings
a
smile
to
your
face.
in
their
presence,
there;s
no
need
for
continuous
conversation,
but
you
find
you;re
quite
content
in
just
having
them
nearby.
things
that
never
interested
you
before
become
fascinating
because
you
know
they
are
important
to
this
person
who
is
so
special
to
you.
you
think
of
this
person
on
every
occasion
and
in
everything
you
do.
simple
things
bring
them
to
mind
like
a
pale
blue
sky,
gentle
wind
or
even
a
storm
cloud
on
the
horizon.
you
open
your
heart
knowing
that
there;s
a
chance
it
may
be
broken
one
day
and
in
opening
your
heart,
you
experience
a
love
and
joy
that
you
never
dreamed
possible.
you
find
that
being
vulnerable
is
the
only
way
to
allow
your
heart
to
feel
true
pleasure
that;s
so
real
it
scares
you.
you
find
strength
in
knowing
you
have
a
true
friend
and
possibly
a
soul
mate
who
will
remain
loyal
to
the
end.
life
seems
completely
different,
exciting
and
worthwhile.
your
only
hope
and
security
is
in
knowing
that
they
are
a
part
of
your
life.
all
that
is
gold
does
not
glitter,
not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost;
the
old
that
is
strong
does
not
wither,
deep
roots
are
not
reached
by
the
frost.
from
the
ashes
a
fire
shall
be
woken,
a
light
from
the
shadows
shall
spring;
renewed
shall
be
blade
that
was
broken,
the
crownless
again
shall
be
king.
the
person,
be
it
gentleman
or
lady,
who
has
not
pleasure
in
a
good
novel,
must
be
intolerably
stupid.
imperfection
is
beauty,
madness
is
genius
and
it;s
better
to
be
absolutely
ridiculous
than
absolutely
boring.
there
are
only
two
ways
to
live
your
life.
one
is
as
though
nothing
is
a
miracle.
the
other
is
as
though
everything
is
a
miracle.
good
friends,
good
books,
and
a
sleepy
conscience:
this
is
the
ideal
life.
the
fool
doth
think
he
is
wise,
but
the
wise
man
knows
himself
to
be
a
fool.
i
am
enough
of
an
artist
to
draw
freely
upon
my
imagination.
imagination
is
more
important
than
knowledge.
knowledge
is
limited.
imagination
encircles
the
world.
i
like
nonsense,
it
wakes
up
the
brain
cells.
fantasy
is
a
necessary
ingredient
in
living.

that
which
does
not
kill
us
makes
us
stronger.
there
is
nothing.
only
warm,
primordial
blackness.
your
conscience
ferments
in
it,
no
larger
than
a
single
grain
of
malt.
time
without
purpose
is
a
prison.
i
have
glimpsed
into
the
mind
of
eternity,
perhaps
the
mind
of
god,
and
found
nothing
but
silence.
i
think
we
should
just
be
friends.
now
i
am
become
death,
the
destroyer
of
worlds.
the
believers,
in
their
mutual
love,
compassion,
and
sympathy
are
like
a
single
body;
if
one
of
its
organs
suffers,
the
whole
body
will
respond
to
it
with
sleeplessness
and
fever.
many
people
were
increasingly
of
the
opinion
that
they;d
all
made
a
big
mistake
in
coming
down
from
the
trees
in
the
first
place.
and
some
said
that
even
the
trees
had
been
a
bad
move,
and
that
no
one
should
ever
have
left
the
oceans
to
begin
with.
we
are
all
just
prisoners
here,
of
our
own
device.
if
you
get
news
of
the

do

and
if

out
in
a
land
in
which
you
are,
do
not
leave
it.
i
can;t
erase
all
the

the
life
of

is
made
up
of
three
days:
yesterday
has
gone
with

may
never

but
today
is
for
you
so

the
most
exciting
phrase
to
hear
in
science,
the
one
that
heralds
the
most
discoveries,
is
not
"eureka!"
(i
found
it!)
but
;that;s
funny...;
he,
who
is
possessed
of
plenty,
and
is
miserly
with
his
great
wealth
toward
his
people,
will
be
dispensed
with,
and
abused.
he
who
keeps
his
word,
will
not
be
reviled;
and
he
whose
heart
is
guided
to
self-satisfying
benevolence
will
not
stammer.

are
about
to

with

of

i;m
not
superstitious
but
i
am
afraid
to
prune
my
money
tree.
it;s
just
that
it;s
the
only
plant
i;ve
ever
had
that;s
seemed
to
actually
grow
healthily.

though
i
know
wealth
is
not
affected
by
a

on
my
shelf,
if
i
take
my
chances
and
my
finances
coincidentally
fail
while
my
money
tree
dies
right
before
my
eyes
then
my
mind
will
think
those
things
coincided
causally.
but
my
tree
needs
pruning
or
else
it;ll
grow
too
wild
and
if
i
do
it
right
then
i
could
propagate
it,
so
why;ve
i
waited
to
prune
this
tree?
i
got
a
letter
from
somebody
here
a
while
back,

they
said,
;bob,
everything
in
your
world
seems
to
be
happy.;
that;s
for

that;s
why
i
paint.
it;s
because
i
can
create
the

language
is
a
process
of

its

the
behaviour
of
the
domestic
cat,
felis
silvestris
catus,
has
many
features
that
set
it
apart
from
other
common
domestic
animals,
even
its
fellow
carnivore
the
dog.
cats
seem
to
have
effected
a
unique
and
successful
compromise
between
reliance
on
man
and
the
retention
of
behaviour
patterns
that
permit
an
independent
existence.
during
the
first
decade
of
the
21st
century
the
cat
has
become
the
preferred
pet
of
many
owners,

because
it
combines
an
affectionate
nature
with
a
degree
of
independence,
as
well
as
more
prosaic
qualities
such
as
cleanliness
and
convenience.
what
do
you
mean?
do
you
wish
me
a
good
morning,
or
mean
that
it
is
a
good
morning
whether
i
want
it
or
not;
or
that
you
feel
good
this
morning;
or
that
it
is
a
morning

let;s
suppose
that
you
were
able
every
night
to
dream
any
dream
that
you
wanted
to
dream.
and
that
you
could,
for
example,
have
the
power
within
one
night
to
dream
75
years
of
time.
or
any
length
of
time
you
wanted
to
have.
and
you
would,
naturally
as
you
began
on
this
adventure
of
dreams,
you
would
fulfill
all
your
wishes.
you
would
have
every
kind
of
pleasure
you
could
conceive.
and
after
several
nights
of
75
years
of
total
pleasure
each,
you
would
say
"well,
that
was
pretty
great."
but
now
let;s
have
a
surprise.
let;s
have
a
dream
which
isn;t
under
control.
where
something
is
gonna
happen
to
me
that
i
don;t
know
what
it;s
going
to
be.
and
you
would
dig
that
and
come
out
of
that
and
say
"wow,
that
was
a
close
shave,
wasn;t
it?"
and
then
you
would
get
more
and
more
adventurous,
and
you
would
make
further
and
further
out
gambles
as
to
what
you
would
dream.
and
finally,
you
would
dream
where
you
are
now.
you
would
dream
the
dream
of
living
the
life
that
you
are
actually
living
today.

hey,
jimmy

we
met
inside.
hi.
you
didn;t
get
it.
you
were
never
gonna
get
it.
they
dangle
these
things
in
front
of
you.
they
tell
you,
you
got
a
chance,
but
i;m
sorry.
it;s
a
lie
because
they
had
already
made
up
their
mind
and
they
knew
what
they
were
going
to
do
before
you
walked
in
the
door.
you
made
a
mistake
and
they
are
never
forgetting
it.
as
far
as
they;re
concerned,
your
mistake
is
just,
it;s
who
you
are.
and
it;s
all
you
are.
and
i;m
not
just
talking
about
the
scholarship
here,
i;m
talking
about
everything.
i
mean,
they;ll
smile
at
you,
they;ll
pat
you
on
the
head,
but
they
are
never,
ever
letting
you
in.
but
listen...
listen...
it
doesn;t
matter.
it
doesn;t
because
you
don;t
need
them.
they;re
not
going
to
give
it
to
you?
so
what?
you;re
going
to
take
it.
you;re
going
to
do
whatever
it
takes.
do
you
hear
me?
you
are
not
going
to
play
by
the
rules.
you;re
going
to
go
your
own
way.
you;re
going
to
do
what
they
won;t
do.
you;re
going
to
be
smart.
you
are
going
to
cut
corners
and
you
are
going
to
win.
they;re
on
the
35th
floor?
you;re
going
to
be
on
the
50th
floor.
you;re
going
to
be
looking
down
on
them.
and
the
higher
you
rise,
the
more
they;re
going
to
hate
you.
good.
good!
you
rub
their
noses
in
it.
you
make
them
suffer.
because
you
don;t
matter
all
that
much
to
them.
so
what?
so
what?
screw
them!
remember...
the
winner
takes
it
all.
you
understand
what
i;m
trying
to
tell
you,
right?
all
right.
all
right.
go
get
them.
i;d
rather
be
hated
for
who
i
am,
than
loved
for
who
i
am
not.
did
you
ever
hear
the
tragedy
of
darth
plagueis
the
wise?
i
thought
not.
it;s
not
a
story
the
jedi
would
tell
you.
it;s
a
sith
legend.
darth
plagueis
was
a
dark
lord
of
the
sith,
so
powerful
and
so
wise
he
could
use
the
force
to
influence
the
midichlorians
to
create
life...
he
had
such
a
knowledge
of
the
dark
side
that
he
could
even
keep
the
ones
he
cared
about
from
dying.
the
dark
side
of
the
force
is
a
pathway
to
many
abilities
some
consider
to
be
unnatural.
he
became
so
powerful...
the
only
thing
he
was
afraid
of
was
losing
his
power,
which
eventually,
of
course,
he
did.
unfortunately,
he
taught
his
apprentice
everything
he
knew,
then
his
apprentice
killed
him
in
his
sleep.
ironic.
he
could
save
others
from
death,
but
not
himself.
my
name
is
yoshikage

i;m
33
years
old.
my
house
is
in
the
northeast
section
of
morioh,
where
all
the
villas
are,
and
i
am
not
married.
i
work
as
an
employee
for

and
i
get
home
every
day
by
8
pm
at
the
latest.
i
don;t
smoke,
but
i
occasionally
drink.
i;m
in
bed
by
11
pm
and
make
sure
i
get
eight
hours
of
sleep,
no
matter
what.
after
having
a
glass
of
warm
milk
and
doing
about
twenty
minutes
of
stretches
before
going
to
bed,
i
usually
have
no
problems
sleeping
until
morning.
just
like
a
baby,
i
wake
up
without
any
fatigue
or
stress
in
the
morning.
i
was
told
there
were
no
issues
at
my
last
check-up.
i;m
trying
to
explain
that
i;m
a
person
who
wishes
to
live
a
very
quiet
life.
i
take
care
not
to
trouble
myself
with
any
enemies,
like
winning
and
losing,
that
would
cause
me
to
lose
sleep
at
night.
that
is
how
i
deal
with
society,
and
i
know
that
is
what
brings
me
happiness.
although,
if
i
were
to
fight
i
wouldn;t
lose
to
anyone.
i
am
the
hope
of
the
omniverse!
i
am

i
am
the
bacon
in
the
fridge
for
all
living
things
that
cry
out
in
hunger!
i
am
the
alpha
and
the
amiga!
i
am
the
terror
that
flaps
in
the
night!
i
am

goku.

i
am

vicariously
as

this

no

this
valorous
visitation
of
a
bygone

to
vanquish
these
venal
and
virulent
vermin

vice
and
vouchsafing
the
violently
vicious
and
voracious
violation

the
only

is
vengeance;
a

in

the

and

verily,
this
vichyssoise
of

most
verbose,

let
me
simply
add
that
it;s
my
very
good
honor
to
meet
you

you
may
call
me

i
was

in

to
promote

players

against

the
ultimate
typing
championship
was
initially
created
by
the
keyboard
manufacturer
das
keyboard.
colemak
is
a
keyboard
layout
for
latin-script
alphabets.
the
layout
is
designed
to
make
typing
more
efficient
and
comfortable
by
placing
the
most
frequently
used
letters
of
the
english
language
on
the
home
row.
created
in
2006,
it
is
named
after
its
inventor,
shai
coleman.
most
major
modern
operating
systems
such
as
mac
os,
linux,
android,
chrome
os,
and
bsd
support
colemak
natively.
a
program
to
install
the
layout
is
available
for
microsoft
windows.
on
android
and
ios,
the
layout
is
offered
by
several
virtual
keyboard
apps
like
gboard
and
swiftkey,
as
well
as
by
many
apps
which
support
physical
keyboards
directly.
the
colemak
layout
was
designed
with
the
qwerty
layout
as
a
base,
changing
the
positions
of
17
keys
while
retaining
the
qwerty
positions
of
most
non-alphabetic
characters
and
many
popular
keyboard
shortcuts,
supposedly
making
it
easier
to
learn
than
dvorak
layout
for
people
who
already
type
in
qwerty
without
losing
efficiency.
it
shares
several
design
goals
with
the
dvorak
layout,
such
as
minimizing
finger
path
distance
and
making
heavy
use
of
the
home
row.
74%
of
typing
is
done
on
the
home
row
compared
to
70%
for
dvorak
and
32%
for
qwerty.
the
default
colemak
layout
lacks
a
caps
lock
key;
an
additional
backspace
key
occupies
the
position
typically
occupied
by
caps
lock
on
modern
keyboards.

i
didn;t
take
the

;cause
it;s
too
small!
i
don;t
care
about
it!
it;s
nothing
to
me!
it;s
a

i
travel
in
worlds
you
can;t
even
imagine!
you
can;t
conceive
of
what
i;m
capable
of!
i;m
so
far
beyond
you!
i;m
like
a

the

arbitrarily

i
spent
last
night
in
the
arms
of
a
girl
in
louisiana,
and
though
i;m
out
on
the
highway,
my
thoughts
are
still
with
her.
such
a
strange
combination
of
a
woman
and
a
child.
such
a
strange
situation
stoppin;

hundred
miles,
callin;
baton

well,
dreams,
they
feel
real
while
we;re
in
them
right?
it;s
only
when
we
wake
up
then
we
realize
that
something
was
actually
strange.
this
reversing
the
flow
of
time,
doesn;t
us
being
here
now,
meant
it
never
happened?
i
was
so
young
when
i
was
born,
my
eyes
could
not
yet
see
and
by
the
time
of
my
first
dawn
somebody
holding
me
they
said
"i
welcome
you
to
crackerbox
palace
we;ve
been
expecting
you.
you
bring
such
joy
in
crackerbox
palace,
no
matter
where
you
roam
know
our
love
is
true"
baby,
you
made
me
believe
i
could
fall
in
love
at
first
sight.

how
you
stopped
me
with
your
body,
i;m
under
your
curse.
i;ve
been
poor
my
whole
life,
like
a
disease
passing
from
generation
to
generation.
but
not
my
boys,
not
anymore.
you
know.
i;ve
been
working
here
for
44
years.
ain;t
nobody
ever
ordered
nothing
but
t-bone
steak
and
a
baked
potato.
except
this
one
asshole
from

to
order

back
in
1987.
we

goddamned

so
either
you
don;t
want

or
you
don;t
want

green

so
what
don;t
you
want?
listen
to
me,
morty.
i
know
that
new
situations
can
be
intimidating.
you;re
lookin;
around
and
it;s
all
scary
and
different,
but
y;know...
meeting
them
head-on,
charging
into
;em
like
a
bull
�
that;s
how
we
grow
as
people.
i
had
a
son...
he
passed
away.
i
had
a
girl
who
loved
me...
i
threw
that
away.
my
momma
died
when
i
was
a
kid...
and
my
daddy...
well,
i
watched
him
die...
and
it
weren;t
soon
enough.
he;s
the
hero
gotham
deserves,
but
not
the
one
it
needs
right
now.
so,
we;ll
hunt
him,
because
he
can
take
it.
because
he;s
not
our
hero.
he;s
a
silent
guardian.
a
watchful
protector.
a
dark
knight.
what
can
i
say
�
i
like
to
talk.
i;m
a
strong
believer
in
the
power
of
words.
if
you;re
not
willing
to
communicate,
then
the
problem
just
sits
there.
if
you
just
keep
staring
at
it
without
doing
anything,
eventually
you;ll
watch
every
last
opportunity
to
resolve
it
slip
away
before
your
eyes.
sons
of
gondor!
of
rohan!
my
brothers.
i
see
in
your
eyes
the
same
fear
that
would
take
the
heart
of
me.
a
day
may
come
when
the
courage
of
men
fails,
when
we
forsake
our
friends
and
break
all
bonds
of
fellowship,
but
it
is
not
this
day.
an
hour
of
wolves
and
shattered
shields
when
the
age
of
men
comes
crashing
down,
but
it
is
not
this
day.
this
day
we
fight!
by
all
that
you
hold
dear
on
this
good
earth,
i
bid
you
stand,
men
of
the
west!
why
not?
maybe
she;s
right.
maybe
i
should;ve
put
it
in
the
paper.
i
should;ve
done
something
different.
the
thing
is,
if
you
just
do
stuff
and
nothing
happens...what;s
it
all
mean?
what;s
the
point?
oh
right,
this
whole
thing
is
about
self-acceptance.
so
i
should
just
stop
judging,
and
accept?
so
no
matter
what
i
do,
hooray
for
me
because
i;m
a
great
guy?
it;s
all
good?
no
matter
how
many
dogs
i
kill,
i
just,
what,
do
an
inventory
and
accept?
i
mean,
you
back
your
truck
over
your
own
kid
and
you,
like,
accept?
what
a
load
of
crap.
where
the
words
are
worn
away,
we
live
to
love
another
day.
where
the
words
are
hard
and
fast,
we
talk
of
nothing
new
but
the
past.
mini-cupcakes?
as
in
the
mini
version
of
regular
cupcakes,
which
is
already
a
mini
version
of
cake?
honestly,
where
does
it
end
with
you
people?
my
worst
breakup
was
with
stacy.
it
was
a
sunday
morning,
we
were
reading
the
paper,
and
i
said,
"oh
my
god,
i
think
the
eagles
could
clinch
the
nfc
east!"
and
she
said,
"we;re
done".
in
a
perfect
world
i;d
have
all
ten
fingers
on
my
left
hand,
so
my
right
would
just
be
a
fist
for
punching
i
can;t
tell
you
how
much
leftover
guacamole
i
have
ended
up
eating
over
the
years.
i
don;t
even
know
why
i
make
it
in
such
great
quantities.
i
found
i
had
to
love
myself
the
way
i
wanted
you
to
love
me.

weak
when
you
are
strong,
and
strong
when
you
are
weak.
you
don;t
get
the
things
you
dream
of,
you
get
the
things
that
you
work
for.
do
i
need
to
be
liked?
absolutely
not.
i
like
to
be
liked.
i
enjoy
being
liked.
i
have
to
be
liked.
but
it;s
not
like
this
compulsive
need
like
my
need
to
be
praised.
stop!
enough!
i
have
heard
more
than
enough
to
render
my
judgement.
for
as
long
as
i
have
known
you,
holger,
you
have
spun
words
into
lies.
you
weaken
the
minds
of
children,
and
delude
the
minds
of
men.
i;ve
shown
you
too
many
years
of
tolerance.
and
rather
than
exist
in
grateful
meekness,
as
holger
the
liar,
you
sink
lower.
you
become
holger
the
thief,
robbing
a
woman
of
her
livelihood,
all
in
the
name
of
your
stupid
stories!
yes,
i
have
a
dream,
and
it;s
not
some
mlk
dream
for
equality.
i
want
to
own
a
decommissioned
lighthouse.
and
i
want
to
live
at
the
top.
and
nobody
knows
i
live
there.
and
there;s
a
button
that
i
can
press,
and
launch
that
lighthouse
into
space.

he;s

that;s
why

made
so
many
of

the

they
let

then

it;s
just...
i
don;t

dream
to
be
a
receptionist.
;cause
you;re
not
a
man.
you;re
just
a
mannequin.
i
wish
you
could
feel
that
my
love
is
real
but
you;re
not
a
man.
too
many
of
us
are
not
living
our
dreams
because
we
are
living
our
fears
but
courage
need
not
be
remembered,
for
it
is
never

from
the
wisconsin
region,
a
nice
firm
cheddar.
also
from
the
great
state
of
wisconsin,
an
aged
parmesan.
uh,
here
you
will
find
a
cheddar-style
spread,
which
has
reacted
nicely
with
the
air
to
form
a
light
rind,
which
i
think
you;ll
find
both
challenging
and
delicious.
at
that
point,
i
would
recommend
you
take
a
quick
trip
south
of
the
border
to
the
great
state
of
illinois,
where
you
will
find
this
fine
blue
cheese
dressing.
if
i
may
be
so
bold,
it;s
a
lot
of
fun
to
let
the
goldfish
take
a
little
swim

the
blue
cheese.
i
was
born
in
a
town
that
was
straight
out
of
a
fairy
tale.
many
people
died
there,
and
when
i
walked
away,
i
held
hands
with
my
other
self.
to
me
it
seemed
like
we
were
the
only
two
people
in
the
world.
neither
one
of
us
possessed
a
real
name.
killing
people
is
simple.
all
you
have
to
do
is
forget
the
taste
of
sugar.
if
my
mind
can
conceive
it,
and
my
heart
can
believe
it,
then
i
can
achieve
it.
when
you
become
untouchable
you
are
unable
to
touch.
it;s
only
after
we;ve
lost
everything
that
we;re
free
to
do
anything.
you;re
going
to
learn
a
lot
of
things.
but
it
might
be
easier
for
you
to
keep
living,
if
you
didn;t
learn
them,
if
you
didn;t
know
them.
you
don;t
realize
your
body
is
on
fire
and
burning
up
because
of
the
things
you
did.
you;ll
understand
one
day.
and
then
you;ll
realize
for
the
first
time
that
you
have
many
burns.
you
either
die
a
hero
or
you
live
long
enough
to
see
yourself
become
the
villain.
if
somehow
the
lord
gave
me
a
second
chance
at
that
moment,
i
would
do
it
all
over
again.
i
worshipped
you!
your
mind,
your
conscience,
wanting
to
help
others...
the
way
you
never
gave
up!
to
achieve
great
things,
two
things
are
needed;
a
plan,
and
not
quite
enough
time.
i;m
dealing
with
fools
and
trolls
and
soft
targets.
it;s
just
strafing
runs
in
my
underwear
before
my
first
cup
of
coffee.
i
don;t
have
time
for
these
clowns.
i;m
different.
i
have
a
different
constitution,
i
have
a
different
brain,
i
have
a
different
heart.
i
got
tiger
blood,
man.
dying;s
for
fools,
dying;s
for
amateurs.
by
the
pricking
of
my
thumbs,
something
wicked
this
way
comes.
the
thousand
injuries
of
fortunato
i
had
borne
as
i
best
could,
but
when
he
ventured
upon
insult
i
vowed
revenge.
ashes,
ashes,
dust
to
dust,
i
think
i
found
a
place
for
us.
it;s
down
by
garden
after
dark,
it;s
in
my
arms,
it;s
in
my
arms.
my
happiness
can
only
be...
can
only
be
made
with
my
own
hands!
my
happiness
doesn;t
depend
on
anyone
but
me!
i
heard
from
a
wise
person
that,
"teamwork
makes
the
dream
work!"
you
need
to
know
who
is
willing
to
work
as
a
team
with
you
first.
you
only
live
once,
but
if
you
do
it
right,
once
is
enough.
how
did
i
escape?
with
difficulty.
how
did
i
plan
this
moment?
with
pleasure.
all
for
one
and
one
for
all,
united
we
stand
divided
we
fall.
"there
are
many
types
of
monsters
in
this

themselves
and
who
cause

monsters
who
abduct
children,
monsters
who
devour
dreams,
monsters
who
suck
blood,
and
monsters
who
always
tell
lies.
lying
monsters
are
a
real
nuisance.
they
are
much
more
cunning
than

they

if
i
were
to

i
would

wake
up

the
longer
you
live,
the
more
you
realize
that
in
this
reality,
only
pain,
suffering,
and
futility
exist.
it
may
be
hard
right
now
but
you
must
silent
those
thoughts.
stop
counting
those
things
you
have
lost,
what
is
gone

gone.
so
ask
yourself,
what
is
there

still

paul

it
is

the
fight
against
censorship
is
open
and
dangerous,
therefore
heroic,
while
the
battle
against
self-censorship
is
anonymous,
lonely
and
unwitnessed,
and
it
makes
its
subject
feel
humiliated.
hello,
hello?
uh,
i
wanted
to
record
a
message
for
you
to
help
you
get
settled
in
on
your
first
night.
um,
i
actually
worked
in
that
office
before
you.
i;m
finishing
up
my
last
week
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so,
i
know
it
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming,
but
i;m
here
to
tell
you
there;s
nothing
to
worry
about.
uh,
you;ll
do
fine.
so,
let;s
just
focus
on
getting
you
through
your
first
week.
okay?
uh,
let;s
see,
first
there;s
an
introductory
greeting
from
the
company
that
i;m
supposed
to
read.
uh,
it;s
kind
of
a
legal
thing,
you
know.
um,
"welcome
to
freddy
fazbear;s
pizza.
a
magical
place
for
kids
and
grown-ups
alike,
where
fantasy
and
fun
come
to
life.
fazbear
entertainment
is
not
responsible
for
damage
to
property
or
person.
upon
discovering
that
damage
or
death
has
occurred,
a
missing
person
report
will
be
filed
within
90
days,
or
as
soon
property
and
premises
have
been
thoroughly
cleaned
and
bleached,
and
the
carpets
have
been
replaced."
blah
blah
blah,
now
that
might
sound
bad,
i
know,
but
there;s
really
nothing
to
worry
about.
uh,
the
animatronic
characters
here
do
get
a
bit
quirky
at
night,
but
do
i
blame
them?
no.
if
i
were
forced
to
sing
those
same
stupid
songs
for
twenty
years
and
i
never
got
a
bath?
i;d
probably
be
a
bit
irritable
at
night
too.
so,
remember,
these
characters
hold
a
special
place
in
the
hearts
of
children
and
we
need
to
show
them
a
little
respect,
right?
okay.
so,
just
be
aware,
the
characters
do
tend
to
wander
a
bit.
uh,
they;re
left
in
some
kind
of
free
roaming
mode
at
night.
uh...
something
about
their
servos
locking
up
if
they
get
turned
off
for
too
long.
uh,
they
used
to
be
allowed
to
walk
around
during
the
day
too.
but
then
there
was
the
bite
of
;87.
yeah.
i-it;s
amazing
that
the
human
body
can
live
without
the
frontal
lobe,
you
know?
uh,
now
concerning
your
safety,
the
only
real
risk
to
you
as
a
night
watchman
here,
if
any,
is
the
fact
that
these
characters,
uh,
if
they
happen
to
see
you
after
hours
probably
won;t
recognize
you
as
a
person.
they;ll
pr-
they;ll
most
likely
see
you
as
a
metal
endoskeleton
without
its
costume
on.
now
since
that;s
against
the
rules
here
at
freddy
fazbear;s
pizza,
they;ll
probably
try
to...forcefully
stuff
you
inside
a
freddy
fazbear
suit.
um,
now,
that
wouldn;t
be
so
bad
if
the
suits
themselves
weren;t
filled
with
crossbeams,
wires,
and
animatronic
devices,
especially
around
the
facial
area.
so,
you
could
imagine
how
having
your
head
forcefully
pressed
inside
one
of
those
could
cause
a
bit
of
discomfort...and
death.
uh,
the
only
parts
of
you
that
would
likely
see
the
light
of
day
again
would
be
your
eyeballs
and
teeth
when
they
pop
out
the
front
of
the
mask,
heh.
y-yeah,
they
don;t
tell
you
these
things
when
you
sign
up.
but
hey,
first
day
should
be
a
breeze.
i;ll
chat
with
you
tomorrow.
uh,
check
those
cameras,
and
remember
to
close
the
doors
only
if
absolutely
necessary.
gotta
conserve
power.
alright,
good
night.
"i;m
like
you,"
he
said.
"i
remember
everything."
i
stopped
for
a
second.
if
you
remember
everything,
i
wanted
to
say,
and
if
you
are
really
like
me,
then
before
you
leave
tomorrow,
or
when
you;re
just
ready
to
shut
the
door
of
the
taxi
and
have
already
said
goodbye
to
everyone
else
and
there;s
not
a
thing
left
to
say
in
this
life,
then,
just
this
once,
turn
to
me,
even
in
jest,
or
as
an
afterthought,
which
would
have
meant
everything
to
me
when
we
were
together,
and,
as
you
did
back
then,
look
me
in
the
face,
hold
my
gaze,
and
call
me
by
your
name.
do
you
come
from
a
land
down
under?
where
women
glow
and
men
plunder.
can;t
you
hear,
can;t
you
hear
the
thunder?
you
better
run,
you
better
take
cover.
i
would
rather
go
swimming
with
great
white
sharks,
than
wade
in
romance.
;cause
i
can
never
find
the
courage
to
ask
her
to
dinner
or
even
to
dance.
maybe
the
best
thing
to
do
is
stop
trying
to
figure
out
where
you;re
going
and
just
enjoy
where
you;re
at.
everyone
is
a
slave
to
their
past.
no
matter
how
much
you
wish
to
move
forward,
the
events
of
last
year
will
bear
down
on
you
like
the
light
of
the
stars
as
soon
as
you
glance
up.
unable
to
laugh
or
to
banish
your
past,
you
carry
it
ceaselessly
in
a
corner
of
your
heart,
waiting
for
it
to
resurrect
at
an
inopportune
moment.
i
don;t
want
other
people
to
mention
my
"self".
besides
if
i
can
be
changed
by
a
few
words,
then
that
wouldn;t
be
my
"self"
would
it?
youth
is
both
a
lie,
and
a
form
of
evil.
those
that
glorify
that
youth
are
only
fooling
themselves
and
those
around
them,
and
believe
that
their
surroundings
always
affirm
their
actions.
by
using
the
word
"youth"
they
twist
and
distort
common
sense
and
anything
logical.
for
them,
lies,
secrets,
sins,
and
failures
do
nothing
but
add
spice
to
their
youth.
can
we
pretend
that
airplanes
in
the
night
sky
are
like
shooting
stars?
i
could
really
use
a
wish
right
now,
wish
right
now,
wish
right
now.
i
just
want
to
lie
on
the
beach
and
eat
hot
dogs.
that;s
all
i;ve
ever
wanted.
and
i
knew
exactly
what
to
do.
but
in
a
much
more
real
sense,
i
had
no
idea
what
to
do.
i
wish
there
was
a
way
to
know
you
were
in
the
good
old
days
before
you;ve
actually
left
them.
someone
should
write
a
song
about
that.
the
scientist
does
not
study
nature
because
it
is
useful;
he
studies
it
because
he
delights
in
it,
and
he
delights
in
it
because
it
is
beautiful.
imagine
an
art
class
in
which
they
only
teach
you
how
to
paint
fences
and
walls,
but
never
show
you
the
paintings
of
the
great
masters.
then
of
course
you
will
say,
;i
hate
art.;
but
in
fact
what
you
would
really
be
saying
is
;i
hate
painting
the
fence.;
i
would
rather
have
questions
that
can;t
be
answered
than
have
answers
that
can;t
be
questioned.
there;s
a
lot
of
beauty
in
ordinary
things.
isn;t
that
kind
of
the
point?
look,
it
doesn;t
take
a
genius
to
know
that
every
organization
thrives
when
it
has
two
leaders.
go
ahead,
name
a
country
that
doesn;t
have
two
presidents;
a
boat
that
sets
sail
without
two
captains.
where
would
catholicism
be,
without
the
popes?
no
man
can
win
every
battle,
but
no
man
should
fall
without
a
struggle.
in
times
of
crisis,
the
wise
build
bridges
while
the
foolish
build
barriers.
i
was
already
slipping
when
you
happened
to
punch
me
in
the
face.
the
two
events
are
not
related.
whatever
happens
tomorrow,
you
must
promise
me
one
thing,
that
you
will
stay
who
you
are.
not
a
perfect
soldier
but
a
good
man.
the
silver
trump
of
freedom
had
roused
my
soul
to
eternal
wakefulness.
freedom
now
appeared,
to
disappear
no
more
forever.
it
was
heard
in
every
sound,
and
seen
in
every
thing.
it
was
ever
present
to
torment
me
with
a
sense
of
my
wretched
condition.
i
saw
nothing
without
seeing
it,
i
saw
heard
nothing
without
hearing
it,
and
felt
nothing
without
feeling
it.
it
looked
in
every
star,
it
smiled
in
every
calm,
breathed
in
every
wind,
and
moved
in
every
storm.
should
anything
happen
to
me
claudia,
should
my
skills
fail
me,
or
my
ambition
lead
me
astray,
do
not
seek
retribution
or
revenge
in
my
memory,
but
fight
to
continue
the
search
for
truth,
so
that
all
may
benefit.
my
story
is
one
of
many
thousands,
and
the
world
will
not
suffer
if
it
ends
too
soon.
in
the
first
age,
in
the
first
battle,
when
the
shadows
first
lengthened,
one
stood.
burned
by
the
embers
of
armageddon,
his
soul
blistered
by
the
fires
of
hell
and
tainted
beyond
ascension,
he
chose
the
path
of
perpetual
torment.
in
his
ravenous
hatred
he
found
no
peace;
and
with
boiling
blood
he
scoured
the
umbral
plains
seeking
vengeance
against
the
dark
lords
who
had
wronged
him.
he
wore
the
crown
of
the
night
sentinels,
and
those
that
tasted
the
bite
of
his
sword
named
him...
the
doom
slayer.
if
you
love
what
you;re
doing,
then
you;ve
already
succeeded.
how
much
love
does
one
need
in
a
lifetime?
is
there
a
quantity
of
brain
space
that
is
allocated
to
love?
and
for
those
of
us
who
have
loved
less,
does
this
space
become
occupied
by
something
else?
like
cricket,
or
religion,
perhaps.
how
many
minutes
of
an
average
life
are
spent
happy?
how
many
are
not?
does
the
sum
of
one
outweigh
the
other?
by
how
much?
i
have
been
told
by
members
of
my
own
family
that
there
is
no
use
or
value
in
sports.
i
only
agree
with
the
first
part.
i
may
be
drunk,
but
i
am
not
stupid.
of
course
there
is
little
point
to
sports.
but,
at
the
risk
of
depressing
you,
let
me
add
two
more
cents.
there
is
little
point
to
anything.
in
a
thousand
years,
grass
will
have
grown
over
all
our
cities.
nothing
of

left-arm
spinners
cannot
unclog
your
drains,
teach
your
children
or
cure
you
of
disease.
but
once
in
a
while,
the
very
best
of
them
will
bowl
a
ball
that
will
bring
an
entire
nation
to
its
feet.
and
while
there
may
be
no
practical
use
in
that,
there
is
most
certainly
value.
i
was
rushing
desperately,
trying
to
reach
the
light.
when
i
thought
i
did,
i
reached
a
dead
end
instead.
then
i
decided
i
wanted
to
enter
that
light.
and
at
the
edge
of
it,
i
found
you.

the
human
mind
works
in
mysterious
ways.
you
just
need
to
see
the
sun
shining
in
the
morning
to
feel
energized.
a
blue
sky
makes
you
feel
happy
you;re
alive.
god,
if
you
really
exist,
then
i
beg
you.
this
is
more
than
enough.
i
don;t
need
anything
else.
we;ll
manage
somehow.
so
please.
don;t
throw
anything
more
at
us.
but
don;t
take
anything
more
from
us
either.
i;m
begging
you.
please,
god.
i
want
to
stay
like
this.
together.
forever
and
ever.
listen,
just
because
you
have
psychic
powers,
it
doesn;t
make
you
any
less
human.
it;s
the
same
as
people
who
are
fast,
people
who
are
book
smart,
and
people
with
strong
body
odor.
psychic
powers
are
just
another
characteristic.
you
must
embrace
that
as
a
part
of
yourself
and
continue
to
live
positively.
the
truth
behind
one;s
charm
is
kindness.
become
a
good
person.
that
is
all.
in
a
world
filled
with
misery
and
uncertainty,
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
in
the
end,
there
is
light
in
the
darkness.
sometimes
i
feel
like
i;ve
already
seen
everything
that;s
gonna
happen
and
it;s
a
nightmare.
sometimes
i
feel
like
love
doesn;t
actually
exist.
it;s
just
pheromones
playing
tricks
on
people.
if
you
only
do
what
you
can
do,
you
will
never
be
more
than
you
are
now.
size
matters
not.
look
at
me.
judge
me
by
my
size,
do
you?
hmm?
hmm.
and
well
you
should
not.
for
my
ally
is
the
force,
and
a
powerful
ally
it
is.
life
creates
it,
makes
it
grow.
its
energy
surrounds
us
and
binds
us.
luminous
beings
are
we,
not
this
crude
matter.
you
must
feel
the
force
around
you;
here,
between
you,
me,
the
tree,
the
rock,
everywhere,
yes.
even
between
the
land
and
the
ship.
when
one
chooses
to
walk
the
way
of
the
mandalore,
you
are
both
hunter
and
prey.
i;ve
seen
what
such
feelings
can
do
to
a
fully
trained
jedi
knight.
to
the
best
of
us.
you
have
something
i
want.
you
may
think

idea

you
do
not.

will
be
back
with
me.

than
you
will
ever
know.
like
walking
into
a
dream,
so
unlike
what
you;ve
seen,
so
unsure
but
it
seems,
;cause
we;ve
been
waiting
for
you.
some
people
are
like
clouds.
when
they
disappear,
it;s
a
beautiful
day.
the
biggest
lie
i
tell
myself
is:
"i
don;t
need
to
write
it
down,
i;ll
remember
it."
alright,
close
your
eyes.
i
want
you
to
think
of
a
flower.
look
at
its
contours,
its
curves.
now
i
want
you
to
imagine
it:
changing,
moving
backwards,
returning
to
its
bud.
think
of
that
bud,
unopened.
look
at
it,
as
a
whole,
and
silently
repeat
these
phrases:
"may
you
be
free
from
suffering.
may
you
be
free
from
fear.
may
you
know
peace
and
joy."
in
this
world,
wherever
there
is
light,
there
are
always
shadows.
as
long
as
there
is
a
concept
of
victory,
the
vanquished
will
also
exist.
the
selfish
desire
for
peace
give
rise
to
war.
and
hatred
is
born
in
order
to
protect
love.
these
are
all
nexuses,
causal
relationships
that
cannot
be
separated.
i;m
tired
of
being
what
you
want
me
to
be.
feeling
so
faithless,
lost
under
the
surface.
don;t
know
what
you;re
expecting
of
me.

under
the
pressure
of
walking
in
your
shoes.
"the
past
is
so
much
less
terrifying
than
the
future,"
he
explained
after
some
coaxing.
"even
the
most

era
of
the
past
is
at

knowable.

can
be

but
in
the
present,
one
never

when
the

survived

but
in
the
present,
oe
never
knows
when
the
whole
world
could
come
to
a
terrible,
crashing
end.
but
still,
what
is
teamwork
really
when
you
get
right
down
to
it?
is
it
just
about
protecting
each
other
and
helping
each
other
out?
i
guess
most
people
would
say
so,
but
they;re
just
fooling
themselves.
i
think
teamwork
is
more
than
that
in
the
end.
it;s
about
individuals
taking
individual
risks
if
you
ask
me.
we
work
together
by
working
separately.
you
stand
up
to
risk
your
own
life.
you
do
what
you
can
the
best
that
you
can,
then
you
turn
to
the
others
and
expect
the
same
from
them.

life
here
is
amazing,

not

the

where
most
folks
enjoy
hobbies
like
whittling

needlepoint,
we
berkians
prefer
a
little
something
we
like
to
call-dragon
racing!
we
are
all
like
fireworks.
we
climb,
shine
and
always
go
our
separate
ways
and
become
further
apart.

even

be

my

she

that;s

love,
even
on
the
days
when
we
aren;t
our
best
;cause
we
all
suck,
but
love
can
make
us
suck
less
we
all
deserve
love,
it;s
the
very
best
part
of
being
alive
and
i
would
know
i
just
turned
25
in
many
ways,
the
work
of
a
critic
is
easy.
we
risk
very
little,
yet
enjoy
a
position
over
those
who
offer
up
their
work
and
their
selves
to
our
judgment.
we
thrive
on
negative
criticism,
which
is
fun
to
write
and
to
read.
but
the
bitter
truth
we
critics
must
face,
is
that
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things,
the
average
piece
of
junk
is
probably
more
meaningful
than
our
criticism
designating
it
so.
but
there
are
times
when
a
critic
truly
risks
something,
and
that
is
in
the
discovery
and
defense
of
the
*new*.
the
world
is
often
unkind
to
new
talent,
new
creations.
the
new
needs
friends.
last
night,
i
experienced
something
new:
an
extraordinary
meal
from
a
singularly
unexpected
source.
to
say
that
both
the
meal
and
its
maker
have
challenged
my
preconceptions
about
fine
cooking
is
a
gross
understatement.
they
have
rocked
me
to
my
core.
in
the
past,
i
have
made
no
secret
of
my
disdain
for
chef
gusteau;s
famous
motto,
"anyone
can
cook."
but
i
realize,
only
now
do
i
truly
understand
what
he
meant.
not
everyone
can
become
a
great
artist;
but
a
great
artist
*can*
come
from
*anywhere*.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
more
humble
origins
than
those
of
the
genius
now
cooking
at
gusteau;s,
who
is,
in
this
critic;s
opinion,
nothing
less
than
the
finest
chef
in
france.
i
will
be
returning
to
gusteau;s
soon,
hungry
for
more.
when
my
grandfather
died,
i
was
ten,
and
nobody
had
ever
died
on
me
before.
all
of
a
sudden,
it
hit
me:
i;m
never
going
to
see
him
again,
but
i
was
wrong.
every
once
in
a
while
i;ll
get
into
a
car
that
has
that
same
stale,
smoky
scent,
and
it
all
comes
back
to
me.
i
look
forward
to
those
flashbacks
of
him,
and
i
wonder
what,
if
anything,
will
remind
people
of
me.
there
are
many
types
of
monsters
in
this
world,
monsters
who
will
not
show
themselves
and
who
cause
trouble.
monsters
who
abduct
children,
monsters
who
devour
dreams,
monsters
who
suck
blood,
and,
monsters
who
always
tell
lies.
lying
monsters
are
a
real
nuisance,
they
are
much
more
cunning
than
other
monsters.
they
pose
as
humans,
even
though
they
have
no
understanding
of
the
human
heart.
they
eat,
even
though
they;ve
never
experienced
hunger.
they
study
even
though
they
have
no
interest
in
academics.
they
seek
friendship
even
though
they
do
not
know
how
to
love.
if
i
were
to
encounter
such
a
monster,
i
would
likely
be
eaten
by
it,
because
in
truth,
i
am
that
monster.

and

i;d
rather
not
choose
at

we;re
the
only
species
in
the
known
universe
that
knows
it;s
in
a
universe.

is

built

so

i;ve
hacked
into
the
covenant
battlenet.
i
will
here
give
a
brief
sketch
of
the
progress
of
opinion
on
the
origin
of
species.
until
recently
the
great
majority
of
naturalists
believed
that
species
were
immutable
productions,
and
had
been
separately
created.
this
view
has
been
ably
maintained
by
many
authors.
some
few
naturalists,
on
the
other
hand,
have
believed
that
species
undergo
modification,
and
that
the
existing
forms
of
life
are
the
descendants
by
true
generation
of
pre
existing
forms.
passing
over
allusions
to
the
subject
in
the
classical
writers,
the
first
author
who
in
modern
times
has
treated
it
in
a
scientific
spirit
was
buffon.
but
as
his
opinions
fluctuated
greatly
at
different
periods,
and
as
he
does
not
enter
on
the
causes
or
means
of
the
transformation
of
species,
i
need
not
here
enter
on
details.
to
the
effects
of
intercrossing
in
eliminating
variations
of
all
kinds,
i
shall
have
to
recur;
but
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
most
animals
and
plants
keep
to
their
proper
homes,
and
do
not
needlessly
wander
about;
we
see
this
even
with
migratory
birds,
which
almost
always
return
to
the
same
spot.
consequently
each
newly-formed
variety
would
generally
be
at
first
local,
as
seems
to
be
the
common
rule
with
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature;
so
that
similarly
modified
individuals
would
soon
exist
in
a
small
body
together,
and
would
often
breed
together.
if
the
new
variety
were
successful
in
its
battle
for
life,
it
would
slowly
spread
from
a
central
district,
competing
with
and
conquering
the
unchanged
individuals
on
the
margins
of
an
ever-increasing
circle.
in
the
first
place,
i
have
collected
so
large
a
body
of
facts,
and
made
so
many
experiments,
showing,
in
accordance
with
the
almost
universal
belief
of
breeders,
that
with
animals
and
plants
a
cross
between
different
varieties,
or
between
individuals
of
the
same
variety
but
of
another
strain,
gives
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring;
and
on
the
other
hand,
that
close
interbreeding
diminishes
vigour
and
fertility;
that
these
facts
alone
incline
me
to
believe
that
it
is
a
general
law
of
nature
that
no
organic
being
fertilises
itself
for
a
perpetuity
of
generations;
but
that
a
cross
with
another
individual
is
occasionally
-
perhaps
at
long
intervals
of
time
-
indispensable.
our
classifications
are
often
plainly
influenced
by
chains
of
affinities.
nothing
can
be
easier
than
to
define
a
number
of
characters
common
to
all
birds;
but
with
crustaceans,
any
such
definition
has
hitherto
been
found
impossible.
there
are
crustaceans
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
series,
which
have
hardly
a
character
in
common;
yet
the
species
at
both
ends,
from
being
plainly
allied
to
others,
and
these
to
others,
and
so
onwards,
can
be
recognised
as
unequivocally
belonging
to
this,
and
to
no
other
class
of
the
articulata.
these
cases
of
close
relationship
in
species
either
now
or
formerly
inhabiting
the
seas
on
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
north
america,
the
mediterranean
and
japan,
and
the
temperate
lands
of
north
america
and
europe,
are
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation.
we
cannot
maintain
that
such
species
have
been
created
alike,
in
correspondence
with
the
nearly
similar
physical
conditions
of
the
areas;
for
if
we
compare,
for
instance,
certain
parts
of
south
america
with
parts
of
south
africa
or
australia,
we
see
countries
closely
similar
in
all
their
physical
conditions,
with
their
inhabitants
utterly
dissimilar.
